37533970|t|Climate-driven shifts in leaf senescence are greater for boreal species than temperate species in the Acadian Forest region in contrast to leaf emergence shifts.
37533970|a|The Acadian Forest Region is a temperate-boreal transitional zone in eastern North America which provides a unique opportunity for understanding the potential effects of climate change on both forest types. Leaf phenology, the timing of leaf life cycle changes, is an important indicator of the biological effects of climate change, which can be observed with stationary timelapse cameras known as phenocams. Using four growing seasons of observations for the species Acer rubrum (red maple), Betula papyrifera (paper/white birch) and Abies balsamea (balsam fir) from the Acadian Phenocam Network as well as multiple growing season observations from the North American PhenoCam Network we parameterized eight leaf emergence and six leaf senescence models for each species which span a range in process and driver representation. With climate models from the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) we simulated future leaf emergence, senescence and season length (senescence minus emergence) for these species at sites within the Acadian Phenocam Network. Model performances were similar across models and leaf emergence model RMSE ranged from about 1 to 2 weeks across species and models, while leaf senescence model RMSE ranged from about 2 to 4 weeks. The simulations suggest that by the late 21st century, leaf senescence may become continuously delayed for boreal species like Betula papyrifera and Abies balsamea, though remain relatively stable for temperate species like Acer rubrum. In contrast, the projected advancement in leaf emergence was similar across boreal and temperate species. This has important implications for carbon uptake, nutrient resorption, ecology and ecotourism for the Acadian Forest Region. More work is needed to improve predictions of leaf phenology for the Acadian Forest Region, especially with respect to senescence. Phenocams have the potential to rapidly advance process-based model development and predictions of leaf phenology in the context of climate change.

37142965|t|Evidence of the involvement of Nematostoma parasiticum in Herpotrichia needle browning of Abies balsamea.
37142965|a|Herpotrichia needle browning (HNB) is a disease that affects several species of firs in Europe and North America. HNB was first described by Hartig in 1884 who isolated a fungal pathogenic agent identified as responsible for the disease. This fungus was later named Herpotrichia parasitica but is currently named Nematostoma parasiticum. However, the identity of the pathogen(s) causing HNB is regularly questioned, and to date, the true causal agent of this disease has not been definitely established. The present study aimed to identify the fungal populations present in needles of Christmas fir trees (Abies balsamea) and to correlate them with needle health status using robust molecular methods. PCR primers specific to N. parasiticum allowed detection of presence of this fungus in DNA samples from symptomatic needles. Furthermore, high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) clearly showed that N. parasiticum was associated with symptomatic needles. However, high throughput sequencing results revealed that the presence of other species such as Sydowia polyspora and Rhizoctonia sp. may also correlate with the development of HNB. A diagnostic tool, based on quantitative PCR using a probe, was then developed to detect and quantify N. parasiticum in DNA samples. The efficacy of this molecular approach was validated through the detection of the pathogenic agent in symptomatic needle samples as well as in non-symptomatic needles collected in trees affected by HNB. In contrast, N. parasiticum could not be found in needles from healthy trees. The present study argues for the importance of N. parasiticum in causing HNB symptoms.

36906726|t|A longer wood growing season does not lead to higher carbon sequestration.
36906726|a|A reliable assessment of forest carbon sequestration depends on our understanding of wood ecophysiology. Within a forest, trees exhibit different timings and rates of growth during wood formation. However, their relationships with wood anatomical traits remain partially unresolved. This study evaluated the intra-annual individual variability in growth traits in balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.]. We collected wood microcores weekly from April to October 2018 from 27 individuals in Quebec (Canada) and prepared anatomical sections to assess wood formation dynamics and their relationships with the anatomical traits of the wood cells. Xylem developed in a time window ranging from 44 to 118 days, producing between 8 and 79 cells. Trees with larger cell production experienced a longer growing season, with an earlier onset and later ending of wood formation. On average, each additional xylem cell lengthened the growing season by 1 day. Earlywood production explained 95% of the variability in xylem production. More productive individuals generated a higher proportion of earlywood and cells with larger sizes. Trees with a longer growing season produced more cells but not more biomass in the wood. Lengthening the growing season driven by climate change may not lead to enhanced carbon sequestration from wood production.

36110871|t|Ecoregion and community structure influences on the foliar elemental niche of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and white birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall).
36110871|a|Changes in foliar elemental niche properties, defined by axes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations, reflect how species allocate resources under different environmental conditions. For instance, elemental niches may differ in response to large-scale latitudinal temperature and precipitation regimes that occur between ecoregions and small-scale differences in nutrient dynamics based on species co-occurrences at a community level. At a species level, we compared foliar elemental niche hypervolumes for balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and white birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall) between a northern and southern ecoregion. At a community level, we grouped our focal species using plot data into conspecific (i.e., only one focal species is present) and heterospecific groups (i.e., both focal species are present) and compared their foliar elemental concentrations under these community conditions across, within, and between these ecoregions. Between ecoregions at the species and community level, we expected niche hypervolumes to be different and driven by regional biophysical effects on foliar N and P concentrations. At the community level, we expected niche hypervolume displacement and expansion patterns for fir and birch, respectively-patterns that reflect their resource strategy. At the species level, foliar elemental niche hypervolumes between ecoregions differed significantly for fir (F = 14.591, p-value = .001) and birch (F = 75.998, p-value = .001) with higher foliar N and P in the northern ecoregion. At the community level, across ecoregions, the foliar elemental niche hypervolume of birch differed significantly between heterospecific and conspecific groups (F = 4.075, p-value = .021) but not for fir. However, both species displayed niche expansion patterns, indicated by niche hypervolume increases of 35.49% for fir and 68.92% for birch. Within the northern ecoregion, heterospecific conditions elicited niche expansion responses, indicated by niche hypervolume increases for fir of 29.04% and birch of 66.48%. In the southern ecoregion, we observed a contraction response for birch (niche hypervolume decreased by 3.66%) and no changes for fir niche hypervolume. Conspecific niche hypervolume comparisons between ecoregions yielded significant differences for fir and birch (F = 7.581, p-value = .005 and F = 8.038, p-value = .001) as did heterospecific comparisons (F = 6.943, p-value = .004, and F = 68.702, p-value = .001, respectively). Our results suggest species may exhibit biogeographical specific elemental niches-driven by biophysical differences such as those used to describe ecoregion characteristics. We also demonstrate how a species resource strategy may inform niche shift patterns in response to different community settings. Our study highlights how biogeographical differences may influence foliar elemental traits and how this may link to concepts of ecosystem and landscape functionality.

36018569|t|Upscaling xylem phenology: Sample size matters.
36018569|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Upscaling carbon allocation requires knowledge of the variability at the scales at which data are collected and applied. Trees exhibit different growth rates and timings of wood formation. However, the factors explaining these differences remain undetermined, making samplings and estimations of the growth dynamics a complicated task, habitually based on technical rather than statistical reasons. This study explored the variability in xylem phenology among 159 balsam firs (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). METHODS: Wood microcores were collected weekly from April to October 2018 in a natural stand in Quebec, Canada, to detect cambial activity and wood formation timings. We tested spatial autocorrelation, tree size, and cell production rates as explanatory variables of xylem phenology. We assessed sample size and margin of error for wood phenology assessment at different confidence levels. KEY RESULTS: Xylem formation lasted between 40 and 110 days, producing between 12 and 93 cells. No effect of spatial proximity or size of individuals was detected on the timings of xylem phenology. Trees with larger cell production rates showed a longer growing season, starting xylem differentiation earlier and ending later. A sample size of 23 trees produced estimates of xylem phenology at a confidence level of 95% with a margin of error of one week. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the high variability in the timings of wood formation among trees within an area of 1 km 2. The correlation between the number of new xylem cells and the growing season length suggests a close connection between the processes of wood formation and carbon sequestration. However, the causes of the observed differences in xylem phenology remain partially unresolved. We point out the need to carefully consider sample size while assessing xylem phenology to explore the reasons underlying this variability and to allow reliable upscaling of carbon allocation in forests.

35948640|t|Even modest climate change may lead to major transitions in boreal forests.
35948640|a|The sensitivity of forests to near-term warming and associated precipitation shifts remains uncertain1-9. Herein, using a 5-year open-air experiment in southern boreal forest, we show divergent responses to modest climate alteration among juveniles of nine co-occurring North American tree species. Warming alone (+1.6  C or +3.1  C above ambient temperature) or combined with reduced rainfall increased the juvenile mortality of all species, especially boreal conifers. Species differed in growth responses to warming, ranging from enhanced growth in Acer rubrum and Acer saccharum to severe growth reductions in Abies balsamea, Picea glauca and Pinus strobus. Moreover, treatment-induced changes in both photosynthesis and growth help explain treatment-driven changes in survival. Treatments in which species experienced conditions warmer or drier than at their range margins resulted in the most adverse impacts on growth and survival. Species abundant in southern boreal forests had the largest reductions in growth and survival due to climate manipulations. By contrast, temperate species that experienced little mortality and substantial growth enhancement in response to warming are rare throughout southern boreal forest and unlikely to rapidly expand their density and distribution. Therefore, projected climate change will probably cause regeneration failure of currently dominant southern boreal species and, coupled with their slow replacement by temperate species, lead to tree regeneration shortfalls with potential adverse impacts on the health, diversity and ecosystem services of regional forests.

35906288|t|Balsam fir (Abies balsamea) needles and their essential oil kill overwintering ticks (Ixodes scapularis) at cold temperatures.
35906288|a|The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, vectors Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacterium that causes Lyme Disease. Although synthetic pesticides can reduce tick numbers, there are concerns about their potential effects on beneficial insects, such as pollinators. Plant-based pest control agents such as essential oils could provide an alternative because they have low environmental persistency; however, these products struggle to provide effective control. We found a new natural acaricide, balsam fir (Abies balsamea) needles, that kill overwintering I. scapularis ticks. We extracted the essential oil from the needles, analyzed its chemical composition, and tested it for acaricidal activity. We placed ticks in tubes with substrate and positioned the tubes either in the field or in incubators simulating winter temperatures. We added balsam fir essential oil, or one of the main components of balsam fir essential oil (i.e., ss-pinene), to each tube. We found that both the oil and ss-pinene kill overwintering ticks. Whole balsam fir needles require several weeks to kill overwintering ticks, while the essential oil is lethal within days at low temperatures (<= 4  C). Further, low temperatures increased the efficacy of this volatile essential oil. Higher temperatures (i.e., 20  C) reduce the acaricidal effectiveness of the essential oil by 50% at 0.1% v/v. Low temperatures may promote the effectiveness of other natural control products. Winter is an overlooked season for tick control and should be explored as a possible time for the application of low toxicity products for successful tick management.

35342593|t|Insect defoliation modulates influence of climate on the growth of tree species in the boreal mixed forests of eastern Canada.
35342593|a|Increasing air temperatures and changing precipitation patterns due to climate change can affect tree growth in boreal forests. Periodic insect outbreaks affect the growth trajectory of trees, making it difficult to quantify the climate signal in growth dynamics at scales longer than a year. We studied climate-driven growth trends and the influence of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) outbreaks on these trends by analyzing the basal area increment (BAI) of 2058 trees of Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Thuja occidentalis L., Populus tremuloides Michx., and Betula papyrifera Marsh, which co-occurs in the boreal mixedwood forests of western Quebec. We used a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to analyze species-specific trends in BAI dynamics from 1967 to 1991. The model relied on tree size, cambial age, degree of spruce budworm defoliation, and seasonal climatic variables. Overall, we observed a decreasing growth rate of the spruce budworm host species, A. balsamea and P. glauca between 1967 and 1991, and an increasing growth rate for the non-host, P. tremuloides, B. papyrifera, and T. occidentalis. Our results suggest that insect outbreaks may offset growth increases resulting from a warmer climate. The observation warrants the inclusion of the spruce budworm defoliation into models predicting future forest productivity.

34442286|t|Avian Predation in a Declining Outbreak Population of the Spruce Budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).
34442286|a|The impact of avian predation on a declining population of the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumifereana (Clem.), was measured using single-tree exclosure cages in a mature stand of balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.), and white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss. Bird population censuses and observations of foraging and nest-feeding activity were also made to determine the response of budworm-linked warblers to decreasing food availability. Seasonal patterns of foraging. as well as foraging success in the declining prey population was compared to similar information from birds observed in another stand where the spruce budworm population was rising. Avian predation was an important source of mortality between the 4th instar and moth emergence in the declining outbreak population. Mortality by predation increased from negligible to over 98% as budworm density dropped from 100 to <1 larva/kg of host foliage, over 3 years. Calculations based on nest-feeding activity and basic metabolic demands support these observed rates. Seasonal and yearly differences in predation rates observed between the two host-tree species correspond to equivalent shifts in bird foraging behavior in response to dropping insect density. In particular, a preference for searching on white spruce disappeared, although budworm-linked birds remained more efficient at finding food on this plant. The ability to change foraging behavior as prey density dropped differed between bird species.

37283699|t|Photosynthetic parameters and stomatal conductance in attached and detached balsam fir foliage.
37283699|a|Leaf level gas-exchange measurements can be made on detached foliage to address the challenge of access to the crown of tall trees. However, detachment may impact leaf gas exchange. This necessitates the study of gas-exchange characteristics of foliage on detached branches to assess the feasibility of using detached branches for gas-exchange analysis. We compared photosynthetic parameters and stomatal conductance in foliage of attached and detached branches of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] during the growing season. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed-effect model, with fixed and random effects (branch status and measurement month, and tree number, respectively). Branch detachment had no significant effects on: (i) photosynthesis at the current ambient CO2 concentration (400 micromol mol-1, A 400); (ii) maximum rates of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation (V cmax) and regeneration (J max); (iii) the ratio of J max to V cmax (i.e., J max:V cmax), and (iv) stomatal conductance (g s) during the study period (p = 0.120-0.335). There was a strong seasonal effect on all gas-exchange variables (p <= 0.001-0.015). Gas-exchange measurements made on detached foliage during the warm summer months should be performed with care. Reliable gas-exchange measurements can be obtained using balsam fir foliage on detached branches 50-80 cm in length, in cooler growing-season months, up to 30 min after detachment.

34143806|t|Conditional inference trees in the assessment of tree mortality rates in the transitional mixed forests of Atlantic Canada.
34143806|a|Long-term predictions of forest dynamics, including forecasts of tree growth and mortality, are central to sustainable forest-management planning. Although often difficult to evaluate, tree mortality rates under different abiotic and biotic conditions are vital in defining the long-term dynamics of forest ecosystems. In this study, we have modeled tree mortality rates using conditional inference trees (CTREE) and multi-year permanent sample plot data sourced from an inventory with coverage of New Brunswick (NB), Canada. The final CTREE mortality model was based on four tree- and three stand-level terms together with two climatic terms. The correlation coefficient (R2) between observed and predicted mortality rates was 0.67. High cumulative annual growing degree-days (GDD) was found to lead to increased mortality in 18 tree species, including Betula papyrifera, Picea mariana, Acer saccharum, and Larix laricina. In another ten species, including Abies balsamea, Tsuga canadensis, Fraxinus americana, and Fagus grandifolia, mortality rates tended to be higher in areas with high incident solar radiation. High amounts of precipitation in NB's humid maritime climate were also found to contribute to heightened tree mortality. The relationship between high GDD, solar radiation, and high mortality rates was particularly strong when precipitation was also low. This would suggest that although excessive soil water can contribute to heightened tree mortality by reducing the supply of air to the roots, occasional drought in NB can also contribute to increased mortality events. These results would have significant implications when considered alongside regional climate projections which generally entail both components of warming and increased precipitation.

33872446|t|Improved performance of the eastern spruce budworm on black spruce as warming temperatures disrupt phenological defences.
33872446|a|Phenological shifts, induced by global warming, can lead to mismatch between closely interacting species. The eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, an important outbreaking insect defoliator in North America, mainly feeds on balsam fir, Abies balsamea, which has historically been well synchronized with the insect. But as climate change pushes the northern range limit of the budworm further north into the boreal forest, the highly valuable black spruce, Picea mariana, historically protected against the budworm by its late budburst phenology, is suffering increased defoliation during the current outbreak. We tested the hypothesis that rising temperatures can lead, not to a mismatch, but to an improved match between the budworm and black spruce through differential phenological advancement. For 3 years, eastern spruce budworm larvae were reared from instar 2 to pupae, on both black spruce and balsam fir, in a temperature free-air controlled enhancement experiment (T-FACE) consisting in 24 field plots, half of which were heated at +2 C from March to October. Our results show that every year, larval development was faster on heated trees and pupation was earlier than on unheated trees. Bud development was also accelerated in heated trees of both species. However, there was no difference in mass between pupae that developed at +2 C and controls at the end of the season. Finally, we found no difference either in development rate or pupal mass between larvae reared on black spruce and those reared on balsam fir. This suggests that under higher temperature regimes, eastern spruce budworm will be as successful on black spruce as on balsam fir, as black spruce budburst becomes better synchronized with the insect's emergence from diapause. This could lead to critical changes in outbreak dynamics and severity with important ecological state shifts at the landscape level.

33033333|t|Improved cis-Abienol production through increasing precursor supply in Escherichia coli.
33033333|a|cis-Abienol, a natural diterpene-diol isolated from balsam fir (Abies balsamea), can be employed as precursors for the semi-synthesis of amber compounds, which are sustainable replacement for ambergris and widely used in the fragmented industry. This study combinatorially co-expressed geranyl diphosphate synthase, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, Labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate synthase and diterpene synthase, with the best combination achieving ~ 0.3 mg/L of cis-abienol. An additional enhancement of cis-abienol production (up to 8.6 mg/L) was achieved by introducing an exogenous mevalonate pathway which was divided into the upper pathway containing acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase/HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase and the lower pathway containing mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, pyrophosphate mevalonate decarboxylase and isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase. The genetically modified strain carrying chromosomal copy of low genes of the mevalonate with the trc promoter accumulated cis-abienol up to 9.2 mg/L in shake flask. Finally, cis-abienol titers of ~ 220 mg/L could be achieved directly from glucose using this de novo cis-abienol-producing E. coli in high-cell-density fermentation. This study demonstrates a microbial process to apply the E. coli cell factory in the biosynthesis of cis-abienol.

32726307|t|Driving factors of conifer regeneration dynamics in eastern Canadian boreal old-growth forests.
32726307|a|Old-growth forests play a major role in conserving biodiversity, protecting water resources, and sequestrating carbon, as well as serving as indispensable resources for indigenous societies. Novel silvicultural practices must be developed to emulate the natural dynamics and structural attributes of old-growth forests and preserve the ecosystem services provided by these boreal ecosystems. The success of these forest management strategies depends on developing an accurate understanding of natural regeneration dynamics. Our goal was therefore to identify the main patterns and drivers involved in the regeneration dynamics of old-growth forests with a focus on boreal stands dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (L.) Mill.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) in eastern Canada. We sampled 71 stands in a 2 200 km2 study area located within Quebec's boreal region. For each stand, we noted tree regeneration (seedlings and saplings), structural attributes (diameter distribution, deadwood volume, etc.), and abiotic (slope and soil) factors. The presence of seed-trees located nearby and slopes having moderate to high angles most influenced balsam fir regeneration. In contrast, the indirect indices of recent secondary disturbances (e.g., insect outbreaks or windthrows) and topographic constraints (slope and drainage) most influenced black spruce regeneration. We propose that black spruce regeneration dynamics can be separated into distinct phases: (i) layering within the understory, (ii) seedling growth when gaps open in the canopy, (iii) gradual canopy closure, and (iv) production of new layers once the canopy is closed. These dynamics are not observed in paludified stands or stands where balsam fir is more competitive than black spruce. Overall, this research helps explain the complexity of old-growth forest dynamics, where many ecological factors interact at multiple temporal and spatial scales. This study also improves our understanding of ecological processes within primary old-growth forests and identifies the key factors to consider when ensuring the sustainable management of old-growth boreal stands.

31392355|t|Fungal Succession During the Decomposition of Ectomycorrhizal Fine Roots.
31392355|a|Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fine roots account for a substantial proportion of forest production and their decomposition releases large amounts of nutrients to the soil ecosystem. However, little is known about the fungi involved in ECM decomposition, including assemblages of fungal saprotrophs, endophytes, and the ECM fungi themselves. To follow fungal succession during the degradation of senescing fine roots, understory seedlings of Abies balsamea and Picea rubens at two sites in the Acadian forest of Nova Scotia were either severed at the root collar or left as controls. Root systems were collected sequentially over two growing seasons and assessed for fine root loss and ECM mantle integrity. ECM were identified by ITS-PCR and grouped into broad morphological categories. Fungal communities colonizing the senescing fine roots were also monitored by systematically constructing clone libraries over the course of the experiment. ECM with cottony, weakly pigmented mantles (e.g., Cortinarius) degraded within the first year. Those with cottony, but intensely pigmented mantles (Piloderma), and smooth mantles with weak pigmentation (Russulaceae) degraded more slowly. Smooth, melanized ECM (Cenococcum and Tomentella) generally maintained integrity over the course of the experiment. Rates of fine root loss and changes in ECM mantle integrity were positively correlated with soil temperature. ECM DNA was detected throughout the experiment, and was not replaced by that of saprotrophic species during the two seasons sampled. However, fungal root endophytes (e.g., Helotiaceae) initially increased in abundance and then decreased as mantles degraded, suggesting a possible role in ECM decomposition.

31385094|t|Responses of bud-break phenology to daily-asymmetric warming: daytime warming intensifies the advancement of bud break.
31385094|a|There is evidence that the ongoing climate change is happening through nighttime rather than daytime warming. How such a daily-asymmetric warming modifies plant phenology is still unclear. We investigated the effects of asymmetric warming on bud break by daily monitoring seedlings belonging to 26 black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.] and 15 balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] provenances from the native range in Canada. Seedlings were subjected to either daytime or nighttime warming in three growth chambers at temperatures ranging between 10 and 24  C. On average, a warming of 4  C advanced the timings of bud break in both species by 2.4 days, with the later phases being more sensitive to the treatment. Bud break of both species responded more strongly to daytime warming, with the bud break occurred 1.2 and 3.2 days earlier under daytime than nighttime warming in black spruce and balsam fir, respectively. A marked ecotypic differentiation was only observed in black spruce that originated from provenances distributed broadly across Canada, with seedlings from the warmest provenance completing bud break 8.3 days later than those from the coldest one. However, no significant effect of provenance was observed for balsam fir, the narrowly distributed species. Overall, the above results suggest that a higher temporal resolution such as temperatures during daytime and nighttime, and higher spatial resolution should be taken into account to improve the accuracy of phenological model predictions under global change scenarios. Phenological models based on daily average temperature should take into account the diverging impacts of asymmetric warming on plant phenology. Our findings may indicate that the influence of warming on plant phenology may be less dramatic than expected.

31379909|t|Facilitation of Balsam Fir by Trembling Aspen in the Boreal Forest: Do Ectomycorrhizal Communities Matter?
31379909|a|Succession is generally well described above-ground in the boreal forest, and several studies have demonstrated the role of interspecific facilitation in tree species establishment. However, the role of mycorrhizal communities for tree establishment and interspecific facilitation, has been little explored. At the ecotone between the mixed boreal forest, dominated by balsam fir and hardwood species, and the boreal forest, dominated by black spruce, several stands of trembling aspen can be found, surrounded by black spruce forest. Regeneration of balsam fir seems to have increased in the recent decades within the boreal forest, and it seems better adapted to grow in trembling aspen stands than in black spruce stands, even when located in similar abiotic conditions. As black spruce stands are also covered by ericaceous shrubs, we investigated if differences in soil fungal communities and ericaceous shrubs abundance could explain the differences observed in balsam fir growth and nutrition. We conducted a study centered on individual saplings to link growth and foliar nutrient concentrations to local vegetation cover, mycorrhization rate, and mycorrhizal communities associated with balsam fir roots. We found that foliar nutrient concentrations and ramification indices (colonization by mycorrhiza per length of root) were greater in trembling aspen stands and were positively correlated to apical and lateral growth of balsam fir saplings. In black spruce stands, the presence of ericaceous shrubs near balsam fir saplings affected ectomycorrhizal communities associated with tree roots which in turn negatively correlated with N foliar concentrations. Our results reveal that fungal communities observed under aspen are drivers of balsam fir early growth and nutrition in boreal forest stands and may facilitate ecotone migration in a context of climate change.

31117507|t|Combinatorial Engineering of Mevalonate Pathway and Diterpenoid Synthases in Escherichia coli for cis-Abienol Production.
31117507|a|Identification of diterpene synthase-encoding genes together with synthetic biology technology offers an opportunity for the biosynthesis of cis-abienol. The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and the mevalonate (MVA) pathways were both engineered for cis-abienol production in Escherichia coli, which improved the cis-abienol yield by approximately 7-fold and 31-fold, respectively, compared to the yield obtained by overexpression of the MEP pathway alone or the original MEP pathway. Furthermore, systematic optimization of cis-abienol biosynthesis was performed, such as diterpene synthase screening and two-phase cultivation. The combination of bifunctional class I/II cis-abienol synthase from Abies balsamea ( AbCAS) and class II abienol synthase from Salvia sclarea ( SsTPS2) was found to be the most effective. By using isopropyl myristate as a solvent in two-phase cultivation, cis-abienol production reached 634.7 mg/L in a fed-batch bioreactor. This work shows the possibility of E. coli utilizing glucose as a carbon source for cis-abienol biosynthesis through a modified pathway.

30715531|t|Contrasting strategies of xylem formation between black spruce and balsam fir in Quebec, Canada.
30715531|a|Present-day global warming is occurring faster at higher elevations. Although there is much information regarding the divergent responses of tree growth to climate change, the altitudinal patterns of species-specific xylogenesis remains poorly understood. We investigated the xylogenesis of balsam fir (Abies balsamea Mill.) and black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. B.S.P.) at two elevations in Quebec (Canada). The number of enlarging and mature cells of the developing tree ring were counted on microcores collected weekly between 2011 and 2014. At the lower site, the growth pattern and duration of xylogenesis were similar between species. No difference in responses to temperature and solar radiation between species was observed. At the higher site, however, cell production was higher and lasted longer in balsam fir than black spruce. Furthermore, the xylem growth of balsam fir had a stronger response to temperature and solar radiation than black spruce. These findings demonstrate the contrasting strategies of wood formation of the two species, with black spruce being more conservative than balsam fir. Our study provides evidence that sympatric species can have species-specific growth dynamics and site-specific responses to the local environment. Predictions of tree growth under a changing environment require the incorporation of species-specific growth strategies.

30581676|t|The recent expansion of Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca iliaca) breeding range into the northeastern United States.
30581676|a|The breeding range of the Eastern Fox Sparrow (Passerella iliaca iliaca) is generally recognized as comprising the boreal forest of Canada. However, recent observations suggest that the species is present during the summer months throughout much of the northeastern US, unexpected for a species characterized as a passage migrant in the region. To clarify, I conducted a literature review to document the historical status of the species in the northeastern US and then analyzed observations submitted to eBird to describe its recent and current status in the region. Historical accounts consistently identify Fox Sparrow as a passage migrant through the region during early spring and late fall. Beginning in the early 1980s, observers began noting regular extralimital records of Fox Sparrow in northern Maine. A single nest was discovered in the state in 1983, and another in northern New Hampshire in 1997. Despite the paucity of breeding records, observations submitted to eBird suggest that the southern limit of the breeding range of Fox Sparrow has expanded rapidly to the south and west in recent years. The proportion of complete checklists submitted to eBird that contained at least one observation of Fox Sparrow grew at an annual rate of 18% from 2003-2016 and was independent of observer effort. Fox Sparrow now occurs regularly on mountaintops and in young stands of spruce (Picea spp.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) during the breeding season throughout northern and western Maine and northern New Hampshire, with occasional records from the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New York. The cause of this rapid expansion of its breeding range is unknown, but may be related to an increase in the amount of young conifer forest in the northeastern US created by commercial timber harvest.

30521099|t|Extreme cold consistently reduces seedling growth but has species-specific effects on browse tolerance in summer.
30521099|a|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Extreme weather events can injure plants, causing decreased survival. However, we may underestimate the ecological importance of extreme events if they have strong sublethal effects that manifest after several months. We tested the hypothesis that late-winter extreme-cold events decrease the ability of woody plants to grow and tolerate stem removal in summer. METHODS: Seedlings from four temperate tree species (Abies balsamea, Pinus resinosa, P. strobus, Quercus rubra) were acclimated to winter conditions in growth chambers, and experienced 1 week of warm temperatures before being exposed to one of three 24-h extreme-cold events (minimum temperature: 8 C control, -8 C, or -16 C). Seedlings were then transferred to a greenhouse where we monitored survival and growth. Three months after the extreme-cold event, we mimicked an herbivore attack by removing either 25% or 75% of new stem growth from seedlings of two species (P. resinosa, Q. rubra). KEY RESULTS: While extreme cold had no immediate effect on seedling survival, the coldest temperature treatment reduced stem growth 51% relative to controls. Stem removal decreased P. resinosa survival in the -16 C treatment, but stem removal treatment had no effect on P. resinosa survival in the intermediate -8 C treatment or 8 C control. Stem removal did not alter Q. rubra survival. CONCLUSIONS: Ephemeral late-winter cold temperatures can have unappreciated effects on growing-season seedling dynamics, including growth and herbivory. For predicting how extreme-cold events might alter large-scale patterns of tree distribution, seedlings should be monitored throughout the growing season following extreme late-winter frosts.

30174675|t|Conifer Regeneration After Experimental Shelterwood and Seed-Tree Treatments in Boreal Forests: Finding Silvicultural Alternatives.
30174675|a|Forest regeneration is a key element in achieving sustainable forest management. Partial harvest methods have been used extensively in temperate broadleaf and mixedwood ecosystems to promote regeneration on poorly stocked sites and to maintain forest composition and productivity. However, their effectiveness in promoting conifer establishment has yet to be demonstrated in unmanaged boreal forests, especially those dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) where constraints for regeneration differ from those found in more meridional regions. We aimed to evaluate conifer seedling density and dimensions, 10 years after the onset of a gradient of silvicultural treatments varying in harvesting intensities, and to identify the critical factors driving the regeneration process. Study blocks of even-aged black spruce stands in the eastern Canadian boreal forest were submitted to three variants of shelterwood harvesting: a seed-tree harvest, a clear-cut and an untreated control. Shelterwood and seed-tree harvesting were combined with spot scarification to promote regeneration. Shelterwood and seed-tree harvesting produced a density of conifer regeneration sufficient to maintain forest productivity, but they did not promote seedling growth. Black spruce was the predominant species in terms of regeneration density, with proportions 3-5x higher than that for balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Ten years after treatment, seed-origin black spruce seedlings were abundant in skidding trails, while layers dominated the residual strips. Balsam fir density was not influenced by treatment nor by tree position relative to skidding trails. Balsam fir and black spruce had different responses to treatment in terms of height and diameter, the former exhibiting a better growth performance and larger diameter in the residual strips. Spot scarification created micro-sites that had a significant impact on the regeneration process. Overall, our results support that shelterwood and seed-tree harvesting combined with scarification enable adequate regeneration in black spruce stands, confirming these treatments as viable silvicultural alternatives to clear-cutting when required by sustainable forest management objectives.

29607018|t|Effect of climatic variation on the morphological characteristics of 37-year-old balsam fir provenances planted in a common garden in New Brunswick, Canada.
29607018|a|The extent of the effect of projected changes in climate on trees remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of climatic variation on morphological traits of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] provenances sourced from locations spanning latitudes from 44  to 51 N and longitudes from 53  to 102 W across North America, growing in a common garden in eastern Canada. Lower latitude provenances performed significantly better than higher latitude provenances (p < .05) with regard to diameter at breast height (DBH), height (H), and crown width (CW), a distinction indicative of genotypic control of these traits. There was, however, no significant difference among provenances in terms of survival (p > .05), an indication of a resource allocation strategy directed at survival relative to productivity in higher latitude provenances as seen in their lower DBH, H, and CW compared to the lower latitude provenances. Temperature had a stronger relationship with DBH, H, and CW than precipitation, a reflection of adaptation to local conditions in populations of the species along latitudinal gradients. Both climatic variables had some effect on tree survival. These results suggest that the response of balsam fir to climatic variation will likely not be uniform in the species, but differ based on genetic characteristics between populations located in the northern and southern parts of the species' range. Population differences in response to climatic variation may be evident earlier in growth traits, compared to survival in balsam fir. The findings of this study will facilitate modeling in the species that is reflective of genetic variation in response to climatic conditions, and guide provenance selection for utilization in terms of productivity or resilience as well as breeding programs directed at obtaining species that possibly combine both traits.

29531697|t|Spatial correlations between browsing on balsam fir by white-tailed deer and the nutritional value of neighboring winter forage.
29531697|a|Associational effects, that is, the influence of neighboring plants on herbivory suffered by a plant, are an outcome of forage selection. Although forage selection is a hierarchical process, few studies have investigated associational effects at multiple spatial scales. Because the nutritional quality of plants can be spatially structured, it might differently influence associational effects across multiple scales. Our objective was to determine the radius of influence of neighbor density and nutritional quality on balsam fir (Abies balsamea) herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in winter. We quantified browsing rates on fir and the density and quality of neighboring trees in a series of 10-year-old cutovers on Anticosti Island (Canada). We used cross-correlations to investigate relationships between browsing rates and the density and nutritional quality of neighboring trees at distances up to 1,000 m. Balsam fir and white spruce (Picea glauca) fiber content and dry matter in vitro true digestibility were correlated with fir browsing rate at the finest extra-patch scale (across distance of up to 50 m) and between cutover areas (300-400 m). These correlations suggest associational effects, that is, low nutritional quality of neighbors reduces the likelihood of fir herbivory (associational defense). Our results may indicate associational effects mediated by intraspecific variation in plant quality and suggest that these effects could occur at scales from tens to hundreds of meters. Understanding associational effects could inform strategies for restoration or conservation; for example, planting of fir among existing natural regeneration could be concentrated in areas of low nutritional quality.

29452424|t|Age-related changes in survival and turnover rates of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) fine roots.
29452424|a|Fine-root (<=2 mm) demographics change as forests age, but the direction and extent of change are unknown. Knowledge of the change and understanding of causes will improve predictions of climate change impacts. We used minirhizotrons at three young and three mature balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) sites to measure median lifespan (MLS) for each site and for annual cohorts. We computed turnover rate from the inverse of MLS (Tinv) and calculated a second turnover rate (T) from annual mortality, annual production and previous year-end standing crop. Median lifespan at mature sites (436 days) was half that at young sites (872 days). Median lifespan of annual cohorts varied widely at all sites. Age-class distributions of fine roots seen by minirhizotrons changed with increasing years of observation, with older age classes accumulating more slowly at mature sites. Our findings highlight the need to determine whether the proportional contributions of absorbing and transporting fine roots to annual production and their median lifespans change during stand development. Due to its variation among annual cohorts, we believe robust estimates of MLS at our sites require 5-7 years of observation, and reliable estimates of Tinv are reached earlier than T.

29378549|t|Anti-apoptotic potential of several antidiabetic medicinal plants of the eastern James Bay Cree pharmacopeia in cultured kidney cells.
29378549|a|BACKGROUND: Our team has identified 17 Boreal forest species from the traditional pharmacopeia of the Eastern James Bay Cree that presented promising in vitro and in vivo biological activities in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We now screened the 17 plants extracts for potential anti-apoptotic activity in cultured kidney cells and investigated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: MDCK (Madin-Darnby Canine Kidney) cell damage was induced by hypertonic medium (700 mOsm/L) in the presence or absence of maximal nontoxic concentrations of each of the 17 plant extracts. After 18 h' treatment, cells were stained with Annexin V (AnnV) and Propidium iodide (PI) and subjected to flow cytometry to assess the cytoprotective (AnnV-/PI-) and anti-apoptotic (AnnV+/PI-) potential of the 17 plant extracts. We then selected a representative subset of species (most cytoprotective, moderately so or neutral) to measure the activity of caspases 3, 8 and 9. RESULTS: Gaultheria hispidula and Abies balsamea are amongst the most powerful cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic plants and appear to exert their modulatory effect primarily by inhibiting caspase 9 in the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: We conclude that several Cree antidiabetic plants exert anti-apoptotic activity that may be relevant in the context of diabetic nephropathy (DN) that affects a significant proportion of Cree diabetics.

28985379|t|Xylogenesis in stems and roots after thinning in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada.
28985379|a|The reduction of competition through thinning increases radial growth in the stem and roots of many conifer species. However, not much is known about the effect of thinning on the dynamics of wood formation and intra-annual development of the growth ring, especially in the roots, which are an essential part of the tree for stability and resource acquisition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an experimental thinning on the dynamics and phenology of xylogenesis in the stem and roots of black spruce and balsam fir. Experimental and control trees were selected in two mature even-aged stands, one black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) and one balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Wood microcores were collected weekly in the stem and roots from May to October for a period of 4 years. The onset and ending of each cell differentiation phase were computed, as well as growth rate and total cell production. Results show that thinning increased the cell production rate of stem and roots of black spruce and balsam fir. This higher daily growth rate caused an increase in the total number of cells produced by the cambium. The intensity of the treatment was sufficient to significantly increase light availability for residual trees, but insufficient to modify soil temperature and water content to a point at which a significant change in the timing or duration of xylogenesis would be induced. Thus, thinning increased cell production rate and total number of cells produced in both stem and roots, but did not result in a change in the phenology of wood formation that could lead to increased risks of frost damage in the spring or autumn.

28770067|t|Division within the North American boreal forest: Ecological niche divergence between the Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) and Gray-cheeked Thrush (C. minimus).
28770067|a|Sister species that diverged in allopatry in similar environments are expected to exhibit niche conservatism. Using ecological niche modeling and a multivariate analysis of climate and habitat data, I test the hypothesis that the Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli) and Gray-cheeked Thrush (C. mimimus), sister species that breed in the North American boreal forest, show niche conservatism. Three tree species that are important components of breeding territories of both thrush species were combined with climatic variables to create niche models consisting of abiotic and biotic components. Abiotic-only, abiotic+biotic, and biotic-only models were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) criterion. Abiotic+biotic models had higher AUC scores and did not over-project thrush distributions compared to abiotic-only or biotic-only models. From the abiotic+biotic models, I tested for niche conservatism or divergence by accounting for the differences in the availability of niche components by calculating (1) niche overlap from ecological niche models and (2) mean niche differences of environmental values at occurrence points. Niche background similarity tests revealed significant niche divergence in 10 of 12 comparisons, and multivariate tests revealed niche divergence along 2 of 3 niche axes. The Bicknell's Thrush breeds in warmer and wetter regions with a high abundance of balsam fir (Abies balsamea), whereas Gray-cheeked Thrush often co-occurs with black spruce (Picea mariana). Niche divergence, rather than conservatism, was the predominant pattern for these species, suggesting that ecological divergence has played a role in the speciation of the Bicknell's Thrush and Gray-cheeked Thrush. Furthermore, because niche models were improved by the incorporation of biotic variables, this study validates the inclusion of relevant biotic factors in ecological niche modeling to increase model accuracy.

28756489|t|How does synchrony with host plant affect the performance of an outbreaking insect defoliator?
28756489|a|Phenological mismatch has been proposed as a key mechanism by which climate change can increase the severity of insect outbreaks. Spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) is a serious defoliator of North American conifers that feeds on buds in the early spring. Black spruce (Picea mariana) has traditionally been considered a poor-quality host plant since its buds open later than those of the preferred host, balsam fir (Abies balsamea). We hypothesize that advancing black spruce budbreak phenology under a warmer climate would improve its phenological synchrony with budworm and hence increase both its suitability as a host plant and resulting defoliation damage. We evaluated the relationship between tree phenology and both budworm performance and tree defoliation by placing seven cohorts of budworm larvae on black spruce and balsam fir branches at different lags with tree budburst. Our results show that on both host plants, spruce budworm survival and pupal mass decrease sharply when budbreak occurs prior to larval emergence. By contrast, emergence before budbreak decreases survival, but does not negatively impact growth or reproductive output. We also document phytochemical changes that occur as needles mature and define a window of opportunity for the budworm. Finally, larvae that emerged in synchrony with budbreak had the greatest defoliating effect on black spruce. Our results suggest that in the event of advanced black spruce phenology due to climate warming, this host species will support better budworm survival and suffer increased defoliation.

28668749|t|Spruce-fir forest changes during a 30-year nitrogen saturation experiment.
28668749|a|A field experiment was established in a high elevation red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) - balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forest on Mount Ascutney Vermont, USA in 1988 to test the nitrogen (N) saturation hypothesis, and to better understand the mechanisms causing forest decline at the time. The study established replicate control, low and high dose nitrogen addition plots (i.e., 0, 15.7 and 31.4kgNH4Cl-Nha-1yr-1). The treatments began in 1988 and continued annually until 2010, but monitoring has continued to present. During the fertilization period, forest floor C:N, net in situ N mineralization, spruce foliar Ca%, and live spruce basal area decreased with increasing N addition, while foliar spruce N% and forest floor net nitrification increased with increasing N addition. The control plots aggraded forest floor N at a rate equal to the sum of the net in situ N mineralization plus average ambient deposition. Conversely, N addition plots lost forest floor N. Following the termination of N additions in 2010, the measured tree components returned to pre-treatment levels, but forest floor processes were slower to respond. During the 30year study, site surface air temperature has increased by 0.5 C per decade, and total N deposition has decreased 5.5 to 4.0kgNha-1yr-1. There have also been three significant drought years and at least one freeze injury year after which much of the forest mortality on the N addition plots occurred. Given that there was no control for the air temperature increase, discussion of the interactive impacts of climate and change and N addition is only subjective. Predicted changes in climate, N deposition and other stressors suggest that even in the absence of N saturation, regeneration of the spruce-fir ecosystem into the next century seems unlikely despite recent region-wide growth increases.

28646398|t|The timing of bud break in warming conditions: variation among seven sympatric conifer species from Eastern Canada.
28646398|a|Phenological changes are expected with the ongoing global warming, which could create mismatches in the growth patterns among sympatric species or create synchrony with insect herbivores. In this study, we performed a comparative assessment of the timings of bud break among seven conifer species of Eastern Canada by evaluating seedling development in growth chambers under different temperatures (16, 20 and 24  C). Bud break occurred earliest in Larix laricina, while Pinus strobus and Pinus resinosa had the latest. Warmer conditions advanced bud break, with the greatest effects being observed at the lower temperatures. Mixed models estimated that one additional degree of temperature produced advancements of 5.3 and 2.1 days at 16 and 20  C, respectively. The hypothesis of an asynchronous change between species under warming was demonstrated only for the last phenological phases (split buds and exposed shoots), and principally in pines. Abies balsamea showed changes in bud break comparable with the other species analysed, rejecting the hypothesis of mismatches under warmer conditions. The observed non-linear responses of the timings of bud break to warming suggest that the major changes in bud phenology should be expected at the lowest temperatures.

34345442|t|Terrestrial acidification and ecosystem services: effects of acid rain on bunnies, baseball, and Christmas trees.
34345442|a|Often termed "acid rain," combined nitrogen and sulfur deposition can directly and indirectly impact the condition and health of forest ecosystems. Researchers use critical loads (CLs) to describe response thresholds, and recent studies on acid-sensitive biological indicators show that forests continue to be at risk from terrestrial acidification. However, rarely are impacts translated into changes in "ecosystem services" that impact human well-being. Further, the relevance of this research to the general public is seldom communicated in terms that can motivate action to protect valuable resources. To understand how changes in biological indicators affect human well-being, we used the STEPS (Stressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services) Framework to quantitatively and qualitatively link CL exceedances to ecosystem service impacts. We specified the cause-and-effect ecological processes linking changes in biological indicators to final ecosystem services. The Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System (FEGS-CS) was used within the STEPS Framework to classify the ecosystem component and the beneficiary class that uses or values the component. We analyzed two acid-sensitive tree species, balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white ash (Fraxinus americana), that are common in northeastern USA. These well-known species provide habitat for animals and popular forest products that are relatable to a broad audience. We identified 160 chains with 10 classes of human beneficiaries for balsam fir and white ash combined, concluding that there are resources at risk that the public may value. Two stories resulting from these explorations into the cascading effects of acid rain on terrestrial resources are ideal for effective science communication: the relationship between (1) balsam fir as a popular Christmas tree and habitat for the snowshoe hare, a favorite of wildlife viewers, and (2) white ash because it is used for half of all baseball bats, fine wood products, and musical instruments. Thus, rather than focusing on biological indicators that may only be understood or appreciated by specific stakeholders or experts, this approach extends the analysis to include impacts on FEGS and humans. It also lays the foundation for developing stakeholder-specific narratives, quantitative measures of endpoints, and for conducting demand-based valuations of affected ecosystem services.

28263421|t|Modelling moose-forest interactions under different predation scenarios at Isle Royale National Park, USA.
28263421|a|Loss of top predators may contribute to high ungulate population densities and chronic over-browsing of forest ecosystems. However, spatial and temporal variability in the strength of interactions between predators and ungulates occurs over scales that are much shorter than the scales over which forest communities change, making it difficult to characterize trophic cascades in forest ecosystems. We applied the LANDIS-II forest succession model and a recently developed ungulate browsing extension to model how the moose population could interact with the forest ecosystem of Isle Royale National Park, USA, under three different wolf predation scenarios. We contrasted a 100-yr future without wolves (no predation) with two predation scenarios (weak, long-term average predation rates and strong, higher than average rates). Increasing predation rates led to lower peak moose population densities, lower biomass removal rates, and higher estimates of forage availability and landscape carrying capacity, especially during the first 40 yr of simulations. Thereafter, moose population density was similar for all predation scenarios, but available forage biomass and the carrying capacity of the landscape continued to diverge among predation scenarios. Changes in total aboveground live biomass and species composition were most pronounced in the no predation and weak predation scenarios. Consistent with smaller-scale studies, high browsing rates led to reductions in the biomass of heavily browsed Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, and Abies balsamea, and increases in the biomass of unbrowsed Picea glauca and Picea mariana, especially after the simulation year 2050, when existing boreal hardwood stands at Isle Royale are projected to senesce. As a consequence, lower predation rates corresponded with a landscape that progressively shifted toward dominance by Picea glauca and Picea mariana, and lacking available forage biomass. Consistencies with previously documented small-scale successional shifts, and population estimates and trends that approximate those from this and other boreal forests that support moose provide some confidence that these dynamics represent a trophic cascade and therefore provide an important baseline against which to evaluate long-term and large-scale effects of alternative predator management strategies on ungulate populations and forest succession.

28207782|t|Incorporating interspecific competition into species-distribution mapping by upward scaling of small-scale model projections to the landscape.
28207782|a|There are a number of overarching questions and debate in the scientific community concerning the importance of biotic interactions in species distribution models at large spatial scales. In this paper, we present a framework for revising the potential distribution of tree species native to the Western Ecoregion of Nova Scotia, Canada, by integrating the long-term effects of interspecific competition into an existing abiotic-factor-based definition of potential species distribution (PSD). The PSD model is developed by combining spatially explicit data of individualistic species' response to normalized incident photosynthetically active radiation, soil water content, and growing degree days. A revised PSD model adds biomass output simulated over a 100-year timeframe with a robust forest gap model and scaled up to the landscape using a forestland classification technique. To demonstrate the method, we applied the calculation to the natural range of 16 target tree species as found in 1,240 provincial forest-inventory plots. The revised PSD model, with the long-term effects of interspecific competition accounted for, predicted that eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), white birch (Betula papyrifera), red oak (Quercus rubra), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) would experience a significant decline in their original distribution compared with balsam fir (Abies balsamea), black spruce (Picea mariana), red spruce (Picea rubens), red maple (Acer rubrum L.), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). True model accuracy improved from 64.2% with original PSD evaluations to 81.7% with revised PSD. Kappa statistics slightly increased from 0.26 (fair) to 0.41 (moderate) for original and revised PSDs, respectively.

27769946|t|New antibacterial hydrophobic assay reveals Abies balsamea oleoresin activity against Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA.
27769946|a|ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Oleoresin of Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. was used by Native Americans of the boreal forest of Canada and French Canadians to treat various infections, suggesting that oleoresin has antibacterial properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, the antibacterial activity of whole oleoresin from A. balsamea was investigated against E. coli, S. aureus and two methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains using a new sensitive assay developed to evaluate hydrophobic matrix and compounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activity of oleoresin was first investigated using dilution and disk diffusion methods against E. coli and S. aureus, and compared to a new sensitive assay for hydrophobic matrix. Moreover, whole oleoresin was analyzed by GC-MS to characterize the composition and to identify the compounds responsible of the antibacterial activity. RESULTS: The results showed that whole oleoresin was inactive against Gram-negative E. coli (MIC90 >90microg/ml) but active against Gram-positive S. aureus and MRSA with MIC90 ranging from 18.2 to 30microg/ml. The oleoresin is mainly composed of monoterpene (28%), sesquiterpenes (2%), and diterpenes (45%). Resin acids were found, in part, responsible for the antibacterial activity of whole oleoresin. Isopimaric acid and levopimaric acid are the most active with a MIC90 of respectively 9.7microg/ml and 10microg/ml. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of oleoresin of A. balsamea by the Native Americans and French Canadians to treat bacterial infections due to S. aureus.

27658686|t|Ectomycorrhizal fungal response to warming is linked to poor host performance at the boreal-temperate ecotone.
27658686|a|Rising temperatures associated with climate change have been shown to negatively affect the photosynthetic rates of boreal forest tree saplings at their southern range limits. To quantify the responses of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities associated with poorly performing hosts, we sampled the roots of Betula papyrifera and Abies balsamea saplings growing in the B4Warmed (Boreal Forest Warming at an Ecotone in Danger) experiment. EM fungi on the root systems of both hosts were compared from ambient and +3.4  C air and soil warmed plots at two sites in northern Minnesota. EM fungal communities were assessed with high-throughput sequencing along with measures of plant photosynthesis, soil temperature, moisture, and nitrogen. Warming selectively altered EM fungal community composition at both the phylum and genus levels, but had no significant effect on EM fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) diversity. Notably, warming strongly favored EM Ascomycetes and EM fungi with short-contact hyphal exploration types. Declining host photosynthetic rates were also significantly inversely correlated with EM Ascomycete and EM short-contact exploration type abundance, which may reflect a shift to less carbon demanding fungi due to lower photosynthetic capacity. Given the variation in EM host responses to warming, both within and between ecosystems, better understanding the link between host performance and EM fungal community structure will to clarify how climate change effects cascade belowground.

27635335|t|Tree phyllosphere bacterial communities: exploring the magnitude of intra- and inter-individual variation among host species.
27635335|a|BACKGROUND: The diversity and composition of the microbial community of tree leaves (the phyllosphere) varies among trees and host species and along spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients. Phyllosphere community variation within the canopy of an individual tree exists but the importance of this variation relative to among-tree and among-species variation is poorly understood. Sampling techniques employed for phyllosphere studies include picking leaves from one canopy location to mixing randomly selected leaves from throughout the canopy. In this context, our goal was to characterize the relative importance of intra-individual variation in phyllosphere communities across multiple species, and compare this variation to inter-individual and interspecific variation of phyllosphere epiphytic bacterial communities in a natural temperate forest in Quebec, Canada. METHODS: We targeted five dominant temperate forest tree species including angiosperms and gymnosperms: Acer saccharum, Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera, Abies balsamea and Picea glauca. For one randomly selected tree of each species, we sampled microbial communities at six distinct canopy locations: bottom-canopy (1-2 m height), the four cardinal points of mid-canopy (2-4 m height), and the top-canopy (4-6 m height). We also collected bottom-canopy leaves from five additional trees from each species. RESULTS: Based on an analysis of bacterial community structure measured via Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S gene, we demonstrate that 65% of the intra-individual variation in leaf bacterial community structure could be attributed to the effect of inter-individual and inter-specific differences while the effect of canopy location was not significant. In comparison, host species identity explains 47% of inter-individual and inter-specific variation in leaf bacterial community structure followed by individual identity (32%) and canopy location (6%). DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that individual samples from consistent positions within the tree canopy from multiple individuals per species can be used to accurately quantify variation in phyllosphere bacterial community structure. However, the considerable amount of intra-individual variation within a tree canopy ask for a better understanding of how changes in leaf characteristics and local abiotic conditions drive spatial variation in the phyllosphere microbiome.

27316353|t|Host species identity, site and time drive temperate tree phyllosphere bacterial community structure.
27316353|a|BACKGROUND: The increasing awareness of the role of phyllosphere microbial communities in plant health calls for a greater understanding of their structure and dynamics in natural ecosystems. Since most knowledge of tree phyllosphere bacterial communities has been gathered in tropical forests, our goal was to characterize the community structure and assembly dynamics of phyllosphere epiphytic bacterial communities in temperate forests in Quebec, Canada. We targeted five dominant tree species: Acer saccharum, Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera, Abies balsamea, and Picea glauca. We collected 180 samples of phyllosphere communities on these species at four natural forest sites, three times during the growing season. RESULTS: Host functional traits (i.e., wood density, leaf nitrogen content) and climate variables (summer mean temperature and precipitation) were strongly correlated with community structure. We highlight three key findings: (1) temperate tree species share a "core microbiome"; (2) significant evolutionary associations exist between groups of bacteria and host species; and (3) a greater part of the variation in phyllosphere bacterial community assembly is explained by host species identity (27 %) and species-site interaction (14 %), than by site (11 %) or time (1 %). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that host species identity is a stronger driver of temperate tree phyllosphere bacterial communities than site or time. Our results suggest avenues for future studies on the influence of host functional traits on phyllosphere community functional biogeography across terrestrial biomes.

26975315|t|Allometric exponents as a tool to study the influence of climate on the trade-off between primary and secondary growth in major north-eastern American tree species.
26975315|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Trees invest in both primary (e.g. height) and secondary (e.g. diameter) growth. The trade-off between these investments varies between species and changes with the tree growing environment. To better establish this trade-off, readily available allometric exponents relating height to diameter at breast height (gamma(h,dbh)) and stem volume to diameter at breast height (alpha(v,dbh)) were simultaneously studied. METHODS: Allometric exponents alpha(v,dbh) and gamma(h,dbh) were obtained from 8893 individual tree stem analyses from two broadleaved species (Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides) and four conifers (Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, Abies balsamea) in the temperate and boreal forests of the province of Quebec, Canada. alpha(v,dbh) and gamma(h,dbh) were related to tree age, stand density index (SDI), and mean temperature (TGS) and total precipitation (PGS) of the growing season. KEY RESULTS: alpha(v,dbh) and gamma(h,dbh) were found to be invariant with PGS and positively related to SDI and TGS for all species except Pinus banksiana. The parameter values associated with SDI and TGS were of higher value for conifers than for broadleaved species. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that conifers and broadleaved species have different growth patterns. This could be explained by their different mode of development, the conifer species having a stronger apical dominance than broadleaved species. Such results could be further considered in allocation studies to quantify future carbon stocks in managed forests.

26920559|t|Labeling Feral Spruce Budworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) Populations With Rubidium.
26920559|a|Rubidium (Rb) is a trace element that occurs naturally in low concentrations and is easily absorbed by plants, making it a useful tool for labeling insect defoliators, such as spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens). Balsam fir trees (Abies balsamea (L.) Miller) injected with either 8 or 16 g per tree of rubidium chloride (RbCl) showed quick uptake and distribution throughout the crown, with no negative effects on tree shoot growth or spruce budworm survival and development. Adult spruce budworm that fed as larvae on trees injected with RbCl were clearly labeled, with significantly higher Rb concentrations than the background levels found in adults that fed as larvae on control trees. Rb concentrations in feral spruce budworm adults for both the 8 g (9 microg/g) and 16 g (25 microg/g) per tree treatments were at least five times lower than those in laboratory-reared adults on 1,000 microg/g RbCl diet (125 microg/g); survival, development, pupal weight, sex ratio, and mating status of spruce budworm were not adversely affected by Rb treatment. Egg masses laid by feral females that fed as larvae on Rb-labeled trees were also labeled with Rb. Injecting trees with RbCl is a viable technique for labeling feral spruce budworm populations to help distinguish local populations from immigrants to better evaluate the success of early intervention strategies such as mating disruption.

26913575|t|Demographic controls of aboveground forest biomass across North America.
26913575|a|Ecologists have limited understanding of how geographic variation in forest biomass arises from differences in growth and mortality at continental to global scales. Using forest inventories from across North America, we partitioned continental-scale variation in biomass growth and mortality rates of 49 tree species groups into (1) species-independent spatial effects and (2) inherent differences in demographic performance among species. Spatial factors that were separable from species composition explained 83% and 51% of the respective variation in growth and mortality. Moderate additional variation in mortality (26%) was attributable to differences in species composition. Age-dependent biomass models showed that variation in forest biomass can be explained primarily by spatial gradients in growth that were unrelated to species composition. Species-dependent patterns of mortality explained additional variation in biomass, with forests supporting less biomass when dominated by species that are highly susceptible to competition (e.g. Populus spp.) or to biotic disturbances (e.g. Abies balsamea). 

26635863|t|Understanding the Physiology of Postharvest Needle Abscission in Balsam Fir.
26635863|a|Balsam fir (Abies balsamea) trees are commonly used as a specialty horticultural species for Christmas trees and associated greenery in eastern Canada and United States. Postharvest needle abscission has always been a problem, but is becoming an even bigger challenge in recent years presumably due to increased autumn temperatures and earlier harvesting practices. An increased understanding of postharvest abscission physiology in balsam fir may benefit the Christmas tree industry while simultaneously advancing our knowledge in senescence and abscission of conifers in general. Our paper describes the dynamics of needle abscission in balsam fir while identifying key factors that modify abscission patterns. Concepts such as genotypic abscission resistance, nutrition, environmental factors, and postharvest changes in water conductance and hormone evolution are discussed as they relate to our understanding of the balsam fir abscission physiology. Our paper ultimately proposes a pathway for needle abscission via ethylene and also suggests other potential alternative pathways based on our current understanding.

26592897|t|DFT Calculations and ROESY NMR Data for the Diastereochemical Characterization of Cytotoxic Tetraterpenoids from the Oleoresin of Abies balsamea.
26592897|a|Eight non-carotenoid tetraterpenoids, abibalsamins C-J (3-10), were isolated from the oleoresin of Abies balsamea. Their chemical structures were determined based on analysis of 1D/2D NMR and MS data. The assignment of their relative configurations was accomplished using homonuclear coupling constants in tandem with ROESY data. However, the presence of two stereogenic centers on a flexible side chain complicated the characterization. In silico models and ROESY data were analyzed in order to assign relative configurations of the isolated tetraterpenoids. Abibalsamins B and H-J showed moderate cytotoxicity against human A549 lung carcinoma cells, with IC50 values ranging between 6.7 and 10 muM.

26454474|t|Spruce Budworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) Oral Secretions II: Chemistry.
26454474|a|As sessile organisms, plants have evolved different methods to defend against attacks and have adapted their defense measures to discriminate between mechanical damage and herbivory by insects. One of the ways that plant defenses are triggered is via elicitors from insect oral secretions (OS). In this study, we investigated the ability of second-instar (L2) spruce budworm [SBW; Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)] to alter the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of four conifer species [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea mariana (Miller) B.S.P., Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Picea rubens (Sargent)] and found that the emission profiles from all host trees were drastically changed after herbivory. We then investigated whether some of the main elicitors (fatty acid conjugates [FACs], beta-glucosidase, and glucose oxidase) studied were present in SBW OS. FACs (glutamine and glutamic acid) based on linolenic, linoleic, oleic, and stearic acids were all observed in varying relative quantities. Hydroxylated FACs, such as volicitin, were not observed. Enzyme activity for beta-glucosidase was also measured and found present in SBW OS, whereas glucose oxidase activity was not found in the SBW labial glands. These results demonstrate that SBW L2 larvae have the ability to induce VOC emissions upon herbivory and that SBW OS contain potential elicitors to induce these defensive responses. These data will be useful to further evaluate whether these elicitors can separately induce the production of specific VOCs and to investigate whether and how these emissions benefit the plant.

26377874|t|Synchronisms and correlations of spring phenology between apical and lateral meristems in two boreal conifers.
26377874|a|Phenological synchronisms between apical and lateral meristems could clarify some aspects related to the physiological relationships among the different organs of trees. This study correlated the phenological phases of bud development and xylem differentiation during spring 2010-14 in balsam fir (Abies balsamea Mill.) and black spruce [(Picea mariana Mill. (BSP)] of the Monts-Valin National Park (Quebec, Canada) by testing the hypothesis that bud development occurs after the reactivation of xylem growth. From May to September, we conducted weekly monitoring of xylem differentiation using microcores and bud development with direct observations on terminal branches. Synchronism between the beginning of bud development and xylem differentiation was found in both species with significant correlations between the phases of bud and xylem phenology. Degree-day sum was more appropriate in assessing the date of bud growth resumption, while thermal thresholds were more suitable for cambium phenology. Our results provide new knowledge on the dynamics of spring phenology and novel information on the synchronisms between two meristems in coniferous trees. The study demonstrates the importance of precisely defining the phases of bud development in order to correctly analyse the relationships with xylem phenology. 

26164238|t|Regulation of liver cell glucose homeostasis by dehydroabietic acid, abietic acid and squalene isolated from balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) a plant of the Eastern James Bay Cree traditional pharmacopeia.
26164238|a|In our previous study, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., a plant used in Cree traditional medicine, had a strong effect on the regulation of glucose homeostasis in liver cells. This study aimed to isolate and identify its active constituents using a bioassay-guided fractionation approach as well as to elucidate their mechanism(s) of action. The effect of the crude extract and its constituents was evaluated on the activity of Glucose-6-Phosphatase (G6Pase) and Glycogen Synthase (GS) and phosphorylation of three kinases, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Akt and Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3). Three compounds, abietic acid, dehydroabietic acid and squalene, were isolated from the most active fraction in the bioassays (hexane). The compounds were able to decrease the activity of G6Pase and to stimulate GS. Their effect on G6Pase activity involved both Akt and AMPK phosphorylation with significant correlations between insulin-dependent and -independent pathways and the bioassay. In addition, the compounds were able to stimulate GS through GSK-3 phosphorylation with a significant correlation between the signaling pathway and the bioassay. Dehydroabietic acid stood out for its strongest effect in all the experiments close to that of the crude extract. These compounds may have potential applications in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance.

26029235|t|Carbon allocation during defoliation: testing a defense-growth trade-off in balsam fir.
26029235|a|During repetitive defoliation events, carbon can become limiting for trees. To maintain growth and survival, the resources have to be shared more efficiently, which could result in a trade-off between the different physiological processes of a plant. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of defoliation in carbon allocation of balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] to test the presence of a trade-off between allocation to growth, carbon storage, and defense. Three defoliation intensities [control (C-trees, 0% defoliation), moderately (M-trees, 41-60%), and heavily (H-trees, 61-80%) defoliated] were selected in order to monitor several variables related to stem growth (wood formation in xylem), carbon storage in stem and needle (non-structural soluble sugars and starch), and defense components in needles (terpenoids compound) from May to October 2011. The concentration of starch was drastically reduced in both wood and leaves of H-trees with a quasi-absence of carbon partitioning to storage in early summer. Fewer kinds of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes were formed with an increasing level of defoliation indicating a lower carbon allocation for the production of defense. The carbon allocation to wood formation gradually reduced at increasing defoliation intensities, with a lower growth rate and fewer tracheids resulting in a reduced carbon sequestration in cell walls. The hypothesis of a trade-off between the allocations to defense components and to non-structural (NCS) and structural (growth) carbon was rejected as most of the measured variables decreased with increasing defoliation. The starch amount was highly indicative of the tree carbon status at different defoliation intensity and future research should focus on the mechanism of starch utilization for survival and growth following an outbreak.

25865063|t|Integrating phylogeography and paleoecology to investigate the origin and dynamics of hybrid zones: insights from two widespread North American firs.
25865063|a|Secondary contact between closely related taxa routinely occurs during postglacial migrations. After initial contact, the location of hybrid zones may shift geographically or remain spatially stable over time in response to various selective pressures or neutral processes. Studying the extent and direction of introgression using markers having contrasted levels of gene flow can help unravel the historical dynamics of hybrid zones. Thanks to their contrasted maternal and paternal inheritance, resulting in different levels of gene flow for mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA (mtDNA and cpDNA), the Pinaceae stand out as a relevant biological model for this purpose. The objective of the study was to assess whether the hybrid zone between Abies balsamea and Abies lasiocarpa (two largely distributed Pinaceae) has moved or remained stable over time by analysing the distribution of cytoplasmic DNA variation as well as published palaeobotanical data. Interspecific gene flow was higher for cpDNA than mtDNA markers; hence, the geographic distribution of mitotypes was more congruent with species distributions than chlorotypes. This genetic signature was contrary to expectations under a moving hybrid zone scenario, as well as empirical observations in other conifers. Genetic evidence for this rare instance of stable hybrid zone was corroborated by the colonization chronology derived from published fossil data, indicating that the two fir species initially came into contact in the area corresponding to the current sympatric zone 11 kyr ago. While an explanatory analysis suggested the putative influence of various environmental factors on the relative abundance of cytoplasmic genome combinations, further research appears necessary to assess the role of both demographic history and selective factors in driving the dynamics of hybrid zones. 

25849816|t|Less pollen-mediated gene flow for more signatures of glacial lineages: congruent evidence from balsam fir cpDNA and mtDNA for multiple refugia in eastern and central North America.
25849816|a|The phylogeographic structure and postglacial history of balsam fir (Abies balsamea), a transcontinental North American boreal conifer, was inferred using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers. Genetic structure among 107 populations (mtDNA data) and 75 populations (cpDNA data) was analyzed using Bayesian and genetic distance approaches. Population differentiation was high for mtDNA (dispersed by seeds only), but also for cpDNA (dispersed by seeds and pollen), indicating that pollen gene flow is more restricted in balsam fir than in other boreal conifers. Low cpDNA gene flow in balsam fir may relate to low pollen production due to the inherent biology of the species and populations being decimated by recurrent spruce budworm epidemics, and/or to low dispersal of pollen grains due to their peculiar structural properties. Accordingly, a phylogeographic structure was detected using both mtDNA and cpDNA markers and population structure analyses supported the existence of at least five genetically distinct glacial lineages in central and eastern North America. Four of these would originate from glacial refugia located south of the Laurentide ice sheet, while the last one would have persisted in the northern Labrador region. As expected due to reduced pollen-mediated gene flow, congruence between the geographic distribution of mtDNA and cpDNA lineages was higher than in other North American conifers. However, concordance was not complete, reflecting that restricted but nonetheless detectable cpDNA gene flow among glacial lineages occurred during the Holocene. As a result, new cpDNA and mtDNA genome combinations indicative of cytoplasmic genome capture were observed. 

25383267|t|A molecular identification protocol for roots of boreal forest tree species.
25383267|a|UNLABELLED:  PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Roots play a key role in many ecological processes, yet our ability to identify species from bulk root samples is limited. Molecular tools may be used to identify species from root samples, but they have not yet been developed for most systems. Here we present a PCR-based method previously used to identify roots of grassland species, modified for use in boreal forests.   METHODS: We used repeatable interspecific size differences in fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphisms of three noncoding chloroplast DNA regions to identify seven woody species common to boreal forests in Alberta, Canada.   RESULTS: Abies balsamea, Alnus crispa, Betula papyrifera, Pinus contorta, and Populus tremuloides were identifiable to species, while Picea glauca and Picea mariana were identifiable to genus. In mixtures of known composition of foliar DNA, species were identified with 98% accuracy using one region. Mixed root samples of unknown composition were identified with 100% accuracy; four species were identified using one region, while three species were identified using two regions.   DISCUSSION: This methodology is accurate, efficient, and inexpensive, and thus a valuable approach for ecological studies of roots. Furthermore, this method has now been validated for both grassland and boreal forest systems, and thus may also have applications in any plant community.

25270601|t|Inhibition of insect glutathione S-transferase (GST) by conifer extracts.
25270601|a|Insecticide synergists biochemically inhibit insect metabolic enzyme activity and are used both to increase the effectiveness of insecticides and as a diagnostic tool for resistance mechanisms. Considerable attention has been focused on identifying new synergists from phytochemicals with recognized biological activities, specifically enzyme inhibition. Jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.), balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), and tamarack larch (Larix laricina (Du Roi) Koch) have been used by native Canadians as traditional medicine, specifically for the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties based on enzyme inhibitory activity. To identify the potential allelochemicals with synergistic activity, ethanol crude extracts and methanol/water fractions were separated by Sephadex LH-20 chromatographic column and tested for in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) inhibition activity using insecticide-resistant Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) midgut and fat-body homogenate. The fractions showing similar activity were combined and analyzed by ultra pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A lignan, (+)-lariciresinol 9'-p-coumarate, was identified from P. mariana cone extracts, and L. laricina and A. balsamea bark extracts. A flavonoid, taxifolin, was identified from P. mariana and P. banksiana cone extracts and L. laricina bark extracts. Both compounds inhibit GST activity with taxifolin showing greater activity compared to (+)-lariciresinol 9'-p-coumarate and the standard GST inhibitor, diethyl maleate. The results suggested that these compounds can be considered as potential new insecticide synergists.

25225397|t|Biogeographic variation in evergreen conifer needle longevity and impacts on boreal forest carbon cycle projections.
25225397|a|Leaf life span is an important plant trait associated with interspecific variation in leaf, organismal, and ecosystem processes. We hypothesized that intraspecific variation in gymnosperm needle traits with latitude reflects both selection and acclimation for traits adaptive to the associated temperature and moisture gradient. This hypothesis was supported, because across 127 sites along a 2,160-km gradient in North America individuals of Picea glauca, Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, and Abies balsamea had longer needle life span and lower tissue nitrogen concentration with decreasing mean annual temperature. Similar patterns were noted for Pinus sylvestris across a north-south gradient in Europe. These differences highlight needle longevity as an adaptive feature important to ecological success of boreal conifers across broad climatic ranges. Additionally, differences in leaf life span directly affect annual foliage turnover rate, which along with needle physiology partially regulates carbon cycling through effects on gross primary production and net canopy carbon export. However, most, if not all, global land surface models parameterize needle longevity of boreal evergreen forests as if it were a constant. We incorporated temperature-dependent needle longevity and %nitrogen, and biomass allocation, into a land surface model, Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange, to assess their impacts on carbon cycling processes. Incorporating realistic parameterization of these variables improved predictions of canopy leaf area index and gross primary production compared with observations from flux sites. Finally, increasingly low foliage turnover and biomass fraction toward the cold far north indicate that a surprisingly small fraction of new biomass is allocated to foliage under such conditions.

25139238|t|Soil response to a 3-year increase in temperature and nitrogen deposition measured in a mature boreal forest using ion-exchange membranes.
25139238|a|The projected increase in atmospheric N deposition and air/soil temperature will likely affect soil nutrient dynamics in boreal ecosystems. The potential effects of these changes on soil ion fluxes were studied in a mature balsam fir stand (Abies balsamea [L.] Mill) in Quebec, Canada that was subjected to 3 years of experimentally increased soil temperature (+4  C) and increased inorganic N concentration in artificial precipitation (three times the current N concentrations using NH4NO3). Soil element fluxes (NO3, NH4, PO4, K, Ca, Mg, SO4, Al, and Fe) in the organic and upper mineral horizons were monitored using buried ion-exchange membranes (PRS  probes). While N additions did not affect soil element fluxes, 3 years of soil warming increased the cumulative fluxes of K, Mg, and SO4 in the forest floor by 43, 44, and 79 %, respectively, and Mg, SO4, and Al in the mineral horizon by 29, 66, and 23 %, respectively. We attribute these changes to increased rates of soil organic matter decomposition. Significant interactions of the heating treatment with time were observed for most elements although no clear seasonal patterns emerged. The increase in soil K and Mg in heated plots resulted in a significant but small K increase in balsam fir foliage while no change was observed for Mg. A 6-15 % decrease in foliar Ca content with soil warming could be related to the increase in soil-available Al in heated plots, as Al can interfere with the root uptake of Ca.

25110133|t|Genetic evidence for three discrete taxa of Melampsora (Pucciniales) affecting willows (Salix spp.) in New York State.
25110133|a|Rust fungi in the genus Melampsora (Pucciniales) are the most important pathogens of shrub willows (Salix spp.) cultivated for biomass in New York State and temperate regions worldwide. The taxonomy and species identification of these fungi historically have been problematic as they are morphologically indistinguishable on willow and often have complex life histories. Melampsora of Salix in North America, therefore, have been circumscribed to the collective species Melampsora epitea Thum. and further delineated to formae speciales by aecial host. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) data was obtained from 75 collections/isolates of Melampsora in NY State affecting either native and cultivated Salix spp. or suspected alternate hosts. Maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and Bayesian (BI) analyses were conducted on three data partitions (individual and concatenated): complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial large subunit (LSU) rDNA sequences for all collections. Analyses of the ITS and concatenated ITS-LSU sequences revealed that Melampsora on native and cultivated willows in NY State consisted of three phylogenetically delineable taxa (phylotaxa); monophyly for each phylotaxon was strongly supported by ML, MP, and BI credibility values. Phylotaxa were also delimited phylogenetically by aecial host: Alpine currant (Ribes alpinum), eastern larch (Larix laricina), or balsam fir (Abies balsamea). 

25098490|t|History of the spruce-fir forest in the Catskill Mountains of New York.
25098490|a|Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) were present by 13,700 years B.C.E. in the Catskills Mountains of southeastern New York State. These conifers were, and still are, largely confined to the eastern and far western portions of the region. A gap in the distribution exists between these populations. Both species are absent from the intervening East Branch Delaware River watershed. No red spruce macrofossils were found in this watershed, suggesting that this conifer never colonized the gap postglacially. Rare macrofossils of balsam fir were found in only three of the 24 peatlands in this watershed, the conifer having disappeared between 11,300 and 8,200 years B.C.E. 

24861414|t|Xylem formation can be modeled statistically as a function of primary growth and cambium activity.
24861414|a|Primary (budburst, foliage and shoot) growth and secondary (cambium and xylem) growth of plants play a vital role in sequestering atmospheric carbon. However, their potential relationships have never been mathematically quantified and the underlying physiological mechanisms are unclear. We monitored primary and secondary growth in Picea mariana and Abies balsamea on a weekly basis from 2010 to 2013 at four sites over an altitudinal gradient (25-900 m) in the eastern Canadian boreal forest. We determined the timings of onset and termination through the fitted functions and their first derivative. We quantified the potential relationships between primary growth and secondary growth using the mixed-effects model. We found that xylem formation of boreal conifers can be modeled as a function of cambium activity, bud phenology, and shoot and needle growth, as well as species- and site-specific factors. Our model reveals that there may be an optimal mechanism to simultaneously allocate the photosynthetic products and stored nonstructural carbon to growth of different organs at different times in the growing season. This mathematical link can bridge phenological modeling, forest ecosystem productivity and carbon cycle modeling, which will certainly contribute to an improved prediction of ecosystem productivity and carbon equilibrium.

24597230|t|A large herbivore triggers alternative successional trajectories in the boreal forest.
24597230|a|Alternative successional trajectories (AST) may result in multiple climax states within an ecosystem when disturbances affect colonization history. In the boreal forest, ungulates have been proposed to drive AST because, under herbivore pressure, preferred species may go extinct and apparent competition may benefit browsing-resistant species. Over a 15-year period following logging, we tested whether deer herbivory altered plant species composition and whether the competitive advantage of resistant species was maintained following herbivore removal. We compared exclosures built immediately after logging with delayed exclosures built eight years later on Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. Although the palatable tree Betula papyrifera (paper birch) and some palatable herbs recovered in delayed exclosures, we observed legacies in both tree and herb cover. Woody regeneration in delayed exclosures was dominated by Picea glauca (white spruce), and Poaceae (grasses) were abundant in the field layer. Given that only early-successional species recovered, whereas late-successional broadleaf species and Abies balsamea (balsam fir) remained rare, succession may follow an AST after a limited browsing period during early succession.

24443326|t|Physiology and growth of advance Picea rubens and Abies balsamea regeneration following different canopy openings.
24443326|a|We examined the ecophysiology and growth of 0.3-1.3 m tall advance red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea [L.] Mill.) regeneration during a 5-year period following the application of different harvest types producing three sizes of canopy openings: (i) small gaps (<100 m(2) in area; SMA) created by partial uniform single-tree harvest; (ii) irregular gaps of intermediate size (100-300 m(2); INT) created by group-selection harvest (removal of groups of trees, mainly balsam fir, with uniform partial removal between groups); and (iii) large circular gaps (700 m(2); LAR) created by patch-selection harvest (removal of trees in 30-m diameter circular areas with uniform partial removal between gaps). An unharvested control (CON) was monitored for comparison. At the ecophysiological level, we mainly found differences in light-saturated photosynthesis of red spruce and specific leaf area of balsam fir among treatments. Consequently, we observed good height growth of both species in CON and INT, but fir surpassed spruce in SMA and LAR. Results suggest that intermediate 100-300 m(2) irregular openings create microenvironmental conditions that may promote short-term ecophysiology and growth of red spruce, allowing the species to compete with balsam fir advance regeneration. Finally, results observed for spruce in large 700-m(2) openings confirm its inability to grow as rapidly as fir in comparable open conditions.

24368754|t|Seedling ontogeny and environmental plasticity in two co-occurring shade-tolerant conifers and implications for environment-population interactions.
24368754|a|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Seedling success is determined by evolved strategies of intrinsic genetic programming and plasticity that are regulated by extrinsic pathways. We tested the relative importance of these mechanisms in red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea Lin.), which share understory regeneration niches in northeastern North America. Although its reproductive effort is adequate, spruce has decreased in abundance, in relation to fir, in seedling and sapling populations, even in forests that have a predominance of spruce in the overstory. METHODS: To understand the factors that regulate this phenomenon and their implications for tree populations, we compared intrinsic and plastic regulation of first- and second-year seedlings under steady understory irradiance levels and in response to increases in light environment. KEY RESULTS: Both species exhibited interactions of ontogenetic patterns and plasticity in first- and second-year seedlings. Physiologically, spruce had higher photosynthetic capacity, allocation to photoprotective xanthophylls, and greater plasticity in response to light treatments. Although both species demonstrated an inability to plastically increase photosynthetic capacity in the short term, spruce benefited from greater allocation to foliage under increased irradiance. Fir showed a conservative strategy in root-shoot allocation that may better equip seedlings to withstand drought adaptations and attributes associated with greater shade tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: These attributes likely contribute to the relative success of fir seedlings in the current climate. By contrast, they indicate that spruce would be a superior competitor in cooler, moister climates, which suggests that future forest composition will be largely determined by an interaction of disturbance and moisture regimes.

24216325|t|Ontogeny and stand condition influence the dispersal behavior of a defoliating specialist caterpillar.
24216325|a|A 4-yr field study was carried out to study the dispersal behavior of young larvae of the eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) within and between crowns of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Miller), through the peak to decline of an outbreak. Newly hatched neonates, searching for overwintering sites in the fall, were frequently captured in sticky traps as they dispersed via "ballooning" (on silken threads) between and within tree crowns. A relatively small proportion of neonates were also captured on sticky tapes as they walked down the trunk toward the lower crown, where most larvae overwinter. In the spring, second-instar larvae (L2) searching for feeding sites also ballooned within and between trees, but were also frequently captured on traps on all crown levels as they walked up trunks. Over the course of our study, defoliation in our study trees increased, and current-year shoot availability decreased significantly, perhaps influencing L2 in search of food to disperse more frequently among hosts via ballooning. Results of our study suggest that the foraging priorities of neonates and L2 significantly influence larval dispersal behaviors and that spruce budworm larvae may vary behaviors in response to changing host condition during an outbreak. 

23946828|t|Lanostane- and cycloartane-type triterpenoids from Abies balsamea oleoresin.
23946828|a|Phytochemical analysis of A. balsamea oleoresin led to the isolation of three new 3,4-seco-lanostane triterpenoids 1-3, one new cycloartane triterpenoid 4 along with fourteen known terpenoids. Structure determinations were based on extensive 1D/2D NMR, IR and MS spectroscopic analyses, and comparison with literature data. The isolated compounds were evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxicity against human cell lines (A549, DLD-1, WS1) and their antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. Abiesonic acid (6) exhibited weak cytotoxic activity against A549 (IC50 = 22 microM) while compounds 1 and 4 were weakly active against S. aureus (MIC = 25 microM).

23874347|t|Interspecific coordination and intraspecific plasticity of fine root traits in North American temperate tree species.
23874347|a|Fine roots play an important role in nutrient and water absorption and hence overall tree performance. However, current understanding of the ecological role of belowground traits lags considerably behind those of aboveground traits. In this study, we used data on specific root length (SRL), fine root diameter (D) and branching intensity (BI) of two datasets to examine interspecific trait coordination as well as intraspecific trait variation across ontogenetic stage and soil conditions (i.e., plasticity). The first dataset included saplings of 12 North American temperate tree species grown in monocultures in a common garden experiment to examine interspecific trait coordination. The second dataset included adult and juvenile individuals of four species (present in both datasets) co-occurring in natural forests on contrasting soils (i.e., humid organic, mesic, and xeric podzolic).The three fine root traits investigated were strongly coordinated, with high SRL being related to low D and high BI. Fine root traits and aboveground life-strategies (i.e., relative growth rate) were weakly coordinated and never significant. Intraspecific responses to changes in ontogenetic stage or soil conditions were trait dependent. SRL was significantly higher in juveniles compared to adults for Abies balsamea and Acer rubrum, but did not vary with soil condition. BI did not vary significantly with either ontogeny or soil conditions, while D was generally significantly lower in juveniles and higher in humid organic soils. D also had the least total variability most of which was due to changes in the environment (plasticity). This study brings support for the emerging evidence for interspecific root trait coordination in trees. It also indicates that intraspecific responses to both ontogeny and soil conditions are trait dependent and less concerted. D appears to be a better indicator of environmental change than SRL and BI.

23864882|t|The action of antidiabetic plants of the canadian james bay cree traditional pharmacopeia on key enzymes of hepatic glucose homeostasis.
23864882|a|We determined the capacity of putative antidiabetic plants used by the Eastern James Bay Cree (Canada) to modulate key enzymes of gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis and key regulating kinases. Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and glycogen synthase (GS) activities were assessed in cultured hepatocytes treated with crude extracts of seventeen plant species. Phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), Akt, and Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) were probed by Western blot. Seven of the seventeen plant extracts significantly decreased G6Pase activity, Abies balsamea and Picea glauca, exerting an effect similar to insulin. This action involved both Akt and AMPK phosphorylation. On the other hand, several plant extracts activated GS, Larix laricina and A. balsamea, far exceeding the action of insulin. We also found a significant correlation between GS stimulation and GSK-3 phosphorylation induced by plant extract treatments. In summary, three Cree plants stand out for marked effects on hepatic glucose homeostasis. P. glauca affects glucose production whereas L. laricina rather acts on glucose storage. However, A. balsamea has the most promising profile, simultaneously and powerfully reducing G6Pase and stimulating GS. Our studies thus confirm that the reduction of hepatic glucose production likely contributes to the therapeutic potential of several antidiabetic Cree traditional medicines.

23604743|t|The effects of throughfall exclusion on xylogenesis of balsam fir.
23604743|a|A 20-40% reduction in soil moisture is projected for the boreal forest of Eastern Canada for the period 2070-99 relative to 1971-2000. In order to better predict the effects of a reduced water supply on the growth of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), a dominant tree species of the boreal forest, we simulated 2 consecutive years of summer droughts (starting in July) by means of throughfall exclusion. Four 100-m(2) plots were established in 2010 with polyethylene sheets maintained 1.3-2 m aboveground and redirecting the water outside the plots. Wood microcores were extracted weekly from mature trees from April to October 2011 to analyse the time dynamics of wood formation in that year. The number of tracheids formed during and before treatment and their anatomical characteristics were determined through microscopic analyses. The growth of lateral and terminal branches and the water potential of balsam fir seedlings were also monitored. Throughfall exclusion significantly reduced soil water content by 5.8% in 2010 and 10.5% in 2011. Xylogenesis was affected significantly by the treatment. Tracheids were 16.1% smaller in diameter and their cell wall was 14.1% thicker during both years. The treatment delayed by more than a week the start of the tracheid differentiation process in the second year with a concomitant decrease (26%) in the number of tracheids produced. The seedlings displayed a 32% reduction in growth and a 40% reduction in leaf water potential. Our results suggest that a future regime of increased frequency and intensity of droughts could have negative effects on the duration of xylogenesis and the production of xylem cells in balsam fir.

26784337|t|Antioxidant Potential of Bark Extracts from Boreal Forest Conifers.
26784337|a|The bark of boreal forest conifers has been traditionally used by Native Americans to treat various ailments and diseases. Some of these diseases involve reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can be prevented by the consumption of antioxidants such as phenolic compounds that can be found in medicinal plants. In this study, ultrasonic assisted extraction has been performed under various solvent conditions (water:ethanol mixtures) on the bark of seven boreal forest conifers used by Native Americans including: Pinus strobus, Pinus resinosa, Pinus banksiana, Picea mariana, Picea glauca, Larix laricina, and Abies balsamea. The total phenolic content, as well as ORACFL potency and cellular antioxidant activity (IC50), were evaluated for all bark extracts, and compared with the standardized water extract of Pinus maritima bark (Pycnogenol), which showed clinical efficiency to prevent ROS deleterious effects. The best overall phenolic extraction yield and antioxidant potential was obtained with Picea glauca and Picea mariana. Interestingly, total phenolic content of these bark extracts was similar to Pycnogenol but their antioxidant activity were higher. Moreover, most of the extracts did not inhibit the growth of human skin fibroblasts, WS1. A significant correlation was found between the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity for water extracts suggesting that these compounds are involved in the activity.

23204491|t|Episodic recruitment of the seedling banks in balsam fir and white spruce.
23204491|a|UNLABELLED:  PREMISE OF THE STUDY: In ecosystems where seed production is low and masting years are sporadic, or with species that have short-lived seeds, regeneration is assured by seedling banks rather than seed banks. Seedling establishment and survival play a critical role in determining the composition of these plant communities by supplying new individuals for their maintenance. Seedling emergence and mortality were investigated to test the hypothesis that recruitment into the seedling bank is periodic.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seed production and seedling emergence and survival was monitored during 1994-2007 in balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and white spruce (Picea glauca) in four pristine stands of the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. Measurements were collected twice per month by sampling one permanent plot of 20 x 20 m per stand.   KEY RESULTS: Seed-rain abundance reached 9 x 10(3) seeds m(-2) year(-1), and was characterized by synchronous sequences of low and high seed production. New seedlings appeared only during the year following a seed production of at least 1 x 10(3) and 1.5 x 10(2) seeds m(-2) year(-1) for balsam fir and white spruce, respectively. Seedlings emerged in July and survived 34-52 d on average, with balsam fir showing a longer lifespan and lower mortality, although 85-99% of seedlings died before completing one year of life.   CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of young seedlings was coupled with massive seed rains, which allowed synchronous replenishment of the seedling banks among stands and species, and generated different cohorts, yielding a discontinuous age structure.

22827135|t|Comparing modern and presettlement forest dynamics of a subboreal wilderness: does spruce budworm enhance fire risk?
22827135|a|Insect disturbance is often thought to increase fire risk through enhanced fuel loadings, particularly in coniferous forest ecosystems. Yet insect disturbances also affect successional pathways and landscape structure that interact with fire disturbances (and vice-versa) over longer time scales. We applied a landscape succession and disturbance model (LANDIS-II) to evaluate the relative strength of interactions between spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) outbreaks and fire disturbances in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA) in northern Minnesota (USA). Disturbance interactions were evaluated for two different scenarios: presettlement forests and fire regimes vs. contemporary forests and fire regimes. Forest composition under the contemporary scenario trended toward mixtures of deciduous species (primarily Betula papyrifera and Populus spp.) and shade-tolerant conifers (Picea mariana, Abies balsamea, Thuja occidentalis), with disturbances dominated by a combination of budworm defoliation and high-severity fires. The presettlement scenario retained comparatively more "big pines" (i.e., Pinus strobus, P. resinosa) and tamarack (L. laricina), and experienced less budworm disturbance and a comparatively less-severe fire regime. Spruce budworm disturbance decreased area burned and fire severity under both scenarios when averaged across the entire 300-year simulations. Contrary to past research, area burned and fire severity during outbreak decades were each similar to that observed in non-outbreak decades. Our analyses suggest budworm disturbances within forests of the BWCA have a comparatively weak effect on long-term forest composition due to a combination of characteristics. These include strict host specificity, fine-scaled patchiness created by defoliation damage, and advance regeneration of its primary host, balsam fir (A. balsamea) that allows its host to persist despite repeated disturbances. Understanding the nature of the three-way interaction between budworm, fire, and composition has important ramifications for both fire mitigation strategies and ecosystem restoration initiatives. We conclude that budworm disturbance can partially mitigate long-term future fire risk by periodically reducing live ladder fuel within the mixed forest types of the BWCA but will do little to reverse the compositional trends caused in part by reduced fire rotations.

22575048|t|Recovery kinetics of photochemical efficiency in winter stressed conifers: the effects of growth light environment, extent of the season and species.
22575048|a|Evergreens undergo reductions in maximal photochemical efficiency (F(v)/F(m)) during winter due to increases in sustained thermal energy dissipation. Upon removing winter stressed leaves to room temperature and low light, F(v)/F(m) recovers and can include both a rapid and a slow phase. The goal of this study was to determine whether the rapid component to recovery exists in winter stressed conifers at any point during the season in a seasonally extreme environment. Additional goals were to compare the effects of species, growth light environment and the extent of the winter season on recovery kinetics in conifers. Four species (sun and shade needle) were monitored during the winter of 2007/2008: eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), Taxus cuspidata and white spruce (Picea glauca). F(v)/F(m) was measured in the field, and then monitored indoors at room temperature and low light for 6 days. The results showed that all species showed a rapid component to recovery in early winter that disappeared later in the season in sun needles but was present in shade needles on most days monitored during winter. There were differences among species in the recovery kinetics across the season, with pine recovering the most slowly and spruce the most quickly. The results suggest an important role for the rapidly reversible form of energy dissipation in early winter, as well as important differences between species in their rate of recovery in late winter/early spring which may have implications for spring onset of photosynthesis.

22394397|t|Abibalsamins A and B, two new tetraterpenoids from Abies balsamea oleoresin.
22394397|a|Abibalsamins A (1) and B (2), two unprecedented tetraterpenoids featuring a 3,4-seco-rearranged lanostane system fused with a beta-myrcene lateral chain via a [4 + 2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition, were isolated from the oleoresin of Abies balsamea. Their structures were elucidated by means of extensive 2D NMR, IR, and MS spectroscopy analyses. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both compounds exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines.

22337889|t|Bifunctional cis-abienol synthase from Abies balsamea discovered by transcriptome sequencing and its implications for diterpenoid fragrance production.
22337889|a|The labdanoid diterpene alcohol cis-abienol is a major component of the aromatic oleoresin of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and serves as a valuable bioproduct material for the fragrance industry. Using high-throughput 454 transcriptome sequencing and metabolite profiling of balsam fir bark tissue, we identified candidate diterpene synthase sequences for full-length cDNA cloning and functional characterization. We discovered a bifunctional class I/II cis-abienol synthase (AbCAS), along with the paralogous levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase and isopimaradiene synthase, all of which are members of the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily. The AbCAS-catalyzed formation of cis-abienol proceeds via cyclization and hydroxylation at carbon C-8 of a postulated carbocation intermediate in the class II active site, followed by cleavage of the diphosphate group and termination of the reaction sequence without further cyclization in the class I active site. This reaction mechanism is distinct from that of synthases of the isopimaradiene- or levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase type, which employ deprotonation reactions in the class II active site and secondary cyclizations in the class I active site, leading to tricyclic diterpenes. Comparative homology modeling suggested the active site residues Asp-348, Leu-617, Phe-696, and Gly-723 as potentially important for the specificity of AbCAS. As a class I/II bifunctional enzyme, AbCAS is a promising target for metabolic engineering of cis-abienol production.

26466722|t|Transmission of a Gammabaculovirus within Cohorts of Balsam Fir Sawfly (Neodiprion abietis) Larvae.
26466722|a|Nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPV: Gammabaculovirus: Baculoviridae) of diprionid sawflies (Diprionidae: Hymenoptera) are highly host specific and only infect the midgut epithelium. While still alive, infected sawfly larvae excrete NPV-laden diarrhea that contaminates food sources. The diarrhea can then be consumed by conspecific larvae, resulting in rapid horizontal transmission of the virus. To better understand the efficacy of Gammabaculovirus-based biological control products, the horizontal spread of such a virus (NeabNPV) within cohorts of balsam fir sawfly (Neodiprion abietis) larvae was studied by introducing NeabNPV-treated larvae into single-cohort groups at densities similar to those observed during the increasing (field study) and peak (laboratory study) phases of an outbreak. In field studies (~200 N. abietis larvae/m2 of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) foliage), NeabNPV-induced mortality increased positively in a density-dependent manner, from 23% (in control groups) to 51% with the addition of one first-instar NeabNPV-treated larva, to 84% with 10 first-instar-treated larvae. Mortality was 60% and 63% when one or 10 NeabNPV-treated third-instar larva(e), respectively, were introduced into groups. Slightly higher levels of NeabNPV-induced mortality occurring when NeabNPV-treated larvae were introduced into first- rather than third-instar cohorts suggests that early instars are more susceptible to the virus. In the laboratory (~1330 N. abietis larvae/ m2 of foliage), NeabNPV-caused mortality increased from 20% in control groups to over 80% with the introduction of one, five or 10 NeabNPV-treated larvae into treatment groups of first-instar larvae. 

26466719|t|Spread of a Gammabaculovirus within Larval Populations of Its Natural Balsam Fir Sawfly (Neodiprion abietis) Host Following Its Aerial Application.
26466719|a|Field trials and assessments of the balsam fir sawfly (Neodiprion abietis) nucleopolyhedrovirus (NeabNPV: Baculoviridae, Gammabaculovirus) against its natural host were conducted in July and August 2002 near Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, in naturally regenerated, precommercially thinned stands dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Two experimental blocks, each with its own untreated control, were established. The purpose of the Island Pond block was to examine the spread of NeabNPV from a 313-ha aerial treatment block out into adjacent populations of balsam fir sawflies. The purpose of the Old Man's Pond block (2,093 ha) was to determine whether NeabNPV could disperse into populations of balsam fir sawflies within a 200-m zone between spray swaths. NeabNPV was applied to treatment blocks by a Cessna 188B AgTruck aircraft equipped with MicronAir AU4000 rotary atomizers at an application rate equivalent to 1 x 108 NeabNPV occlusion bodies/ha in 2.5 L of 20% aqueous molasses. At Island Pond, NeabNPV infection increased with time following the spray, especially for individuals close to the treatment block, and infection rate decreased to a measured distance of 400 m from the treatment block. At Old Man's Pond, NeabNPV infection rose higher (80% vs. 15%) and sawfly densities declined more (84% vs. 60%) in the area between spray swaths than in the control block. 

22077965|t|Carry-over effect of host nutritional quality on performance of spruce budworm progeny.
22077965|a|The effect of host nutritional quality on spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens)) parental and offspring performance was studied using field and laboratory rearing experiments, and foliar chemical analyses. Foliage of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and black spruce (P. mariana (Mill.) BSP) was used to rear the parental generation in the field, whereas an artificial diet was used to rear the progeny under laboratory conditions. Important differences in the food quality were provided by the three hosts. Black spruce foliage had higher concentrations of certain monoterpene deterrents and total phenolics, together with stronger seasonal declines in nutrients such as N, P and Mg, compared with the other hosts. We hypothesise that this trend may be related to poor performance and survival of the progeny. Laboratory rearing showed that progeny of parents that fed on black spruce exhibited longer developmental times and greater mortality, and had lower pupal mass than progeny of parents fed on the other hosts. Further, artificial food-fed progeny of insects reared on black spruce reached sixth-instar later, with lower mass, and exhibited higher relative growth rate (RGR) than progeny of parents fed on the other hosts. These results suggest nutritionally-based parental effects. These results also confirmed that the quality of food consumed by the parents can influence the fitness of the next generation.

21939054|t|Two-dimensional wavelet analysis of spruce budworm host basal area in the Border Lakes landscape.
21939054|a|Increases in the extent and severity of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) outbreaks over the last century are thought to be the result of changes in forest structure due to forest management. A corollary of this hypothesis is that manipulations of forest structure and composition can be used to reduce future forest vulnerability. However, to what extent historical forest management has influenced current spatial patterns of spruce budworm host species is unknown. To identify landscape-scale spatial legacies of forest management in patterns of spruce budworm host species (i.e., Abies balsamea and Picea spp.), we analyzed remotely sensed forest data from the Border Lakes landscape of northern Minnesota and northwestern Ontario. Our study area contains three regions with different management histories: (1) fine-scale logging patterns in Minnesota, (2) coarse-scale logging patterns in Ontario, and (3) very limited logging history in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and adjacent Quetico Provincial Park. We analyzed forest basal-area data using wavelets and null models to identify: (1) at which scales forest basal area is structured, (2) where those scales of pattern are significantly present, and (3) whether regions of local significance correspond to regional boundaries that separate the study area. Results indicate that spatial patterns in host basal area are created by nonstationary processes and that these processes are further constrained by lakes and wetlands. Wavelet analysis combined with significance testing revealed a bimodal distribution of scale-specific wavelet variance and separate zones of host species basal area that partially correspond with regional boundaries, particularly between Minnesota and the Wilderness region. This research represents one of the first comparisons of forest spatial structure in this region across an international border and presents a novel method of two-dimensional wavelet analysis that can be used to identify significant scale-specific structure in spatial data.

21796758|t|Site factors and management influence short-term host resistance to spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.), in a species-specific manner.
21796758|a|BACKGROUND: This study examined the interactions between thinning and soil drainage classes on the resistance of balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill, white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, and black spruce, P. mariana (Mill.) BSP, to spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.), defoliation 1 year after treatment. To estimate host tree resistance, foliage production and larval foliage consumption were determined to generate an index of resistance quantifying the amount of residual foliage available for photosynthesis after insect defoliation. RESULTS: Significant interactions on tree resistance and foliage chemistry were detected between thinning and soil drainage in balsam fir. Drainage class affected spruce budworm performance, foliar chemistry and balsam fir resistance to spruce budworm, whereas no effect was found in white spruce. Thinning had a significant effect on the foliar chemistry of balsam fir and white spruce, but no effect on black spruce. CONCLUSION: Thinning reduced balsam fir resistance to spruce budworm defoliation. This response is due to increased defoliation linked to reduction in concentrations of certain monoterpenes, and a decrease in foliage production, except on hydric drainage, demonstrating the importance of drainage class to tree resistance. The results suggest that the use of Bacillus thuringiensis might be required when conducting stand thinning during spruce budworm outbreaks.

21489968|t|Effects of soil moisture manipulations on fine root dynamics in a mature balsam fir (Abies balsamea L. Mill.) forest.
21489968|a|We tested the hypothesis that moisture stress affects fine root dynamics during and after the stress. To this end, we investigated the effects of soil moisture on annual and seasonal fine root production and mortality over 4 years in a mature balsam fir (Abies balsamea L. Mill.) stand using a minirhizotron and soil coring. Droughting and irrigating treatments were imposed for 17 weeks during the third year of the study, and post-treatment recovery was measured during the fourth year. Monthly fine root production was often reduced by low soil water content (SWC) during July-September in the pre-treatment years and by imposed drought. Irrigation resulted in higher summer fine root production than in pre-treatment years. In the recovery year, increased fine root production was observed in the previously droughted plots despite low SWC in August and September. Droughting decreased year-end fine root biomass in the treatment year, but biomass returned to pre-treatment levels during the recovery year. Droughting and irrigating did not affect foliage production during the treatment and recovery years. Our results suggest that for balsam fir, establishment and maintenance of a functional balance between foliage and fine root biomass, with respect to moisture supply and demand, can depend on fine root dynamics occurring over more than one growing season. In addition, our findings provided insights into tree growth responses to interannual variation in moisture supply.

21475991|t|Host associations between fungal root endophytes and boreal trees.
21475991|a|Fungal root endophytes colonize root tissue concomitantly with mycorrhizal fungi, but their identities and host preferences are largely unknown. We cultured fungal endophytes from surface-sterilized Cenococcum geophilum ectomycorrhizae of Betula papyrifera, Abies balsamea, and Picea glauca from two boreal sites in eastern Canada. Isolates were initially grouped on the basis of cultural morphology and then identified by internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA sequencing or by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequence data revealed 31 distinct phylotypes among the isolates, comprising mainly members of the ascomycete families Helotiaceae, Dermateaceae, Myxotrichaceae, and Hyaloscyphaceae, although other fungi were also isolated. Multivariate analyses indicate a clear separation among the endophyte communities colonizing each host tree species. Some phylotypes were evenly distributed across the roots of all three host species, some were found preferentially on particular hosts, and others were isolated from single hosts only. The results indicate that fungal root endophytes of boreal trees are not randomly distributed, but instead form relatively distinct assemblages on different host tree species.

21186373|t|Cree antidiabetic plant extracts display mechanism-based inactivation of CYP3A4.
21186373|a|Seventeen Cree antidiabetic medicinal plants were studied to determine their potential to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) through mechanism-based inactivation (MBI). The ethanolic extracts of the medicinal plants were studied for their inhibition of CYP3A4 using the substrates testosterone and dibenzylfluorescein (DBF) in high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and microtiter fluorometric assays, respectively. Using testosterone as a substrate, extracts of Alnus incana, Sarracenia purpurea, and Lycopodium clavatum were identified as potent CYP3A4 MBIs, while those from Abies balsamea, Picea mariana, Pinus banksiana, Rhododendron tomentosum, Kalmia angustifolia, and Picea glauca were identified as less potent inactivators. Not unexpectedly, the other substrate, DBF, showed a different profile of inhibition. Only A. balsamea was identified as a CYP3A4 MBI using DBF. Abies balsamea displayed both NADPH- and time-dependence of CYP3A4 inhibition using both substrates. Overall, several of the medicinal plants may markedly deplete CYP3A4 through MBI and, consequently, decrease the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates including numerous medications used by diabetics.

22127165|t|Selected beetle assemblages captured in pitfall traps baited with deer dung or meat in balsam fir and sugar maple forests of central Quebec.
22127165|a|Vertebrate dung and carrion are rich and strongly attractive resources for numerous beetles that are often closely linked to them. The presence and abundance of beetles exploiting such resources are influenced by various ecological factors including climate and forest cover vegetation.  We studied selected assemblages of coprophilous and necrophagous beetles in Quebec along a 115-km north-south transect in three balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Miller) forest sites and in a fourth forest site dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall), close to the southern  fir site. Beetle abundance was estimated using a sampling design comprising replicated pitfall traps baited with red deer meat or dung in each site. A total of 8,511 beetles were caught and identified to family level, 95.7% of which belonged to families with known coprophilous or necrophagous  behavior. Meat-baited pitfall traps caught nearly 15 times as many beetles as dung-baited traps. All Histeridae, Hydrophilidae, Scarabaeidae, and Silphidae were identified to species to examine specific diversity variation among sites. For the beetles caught in the meat-baited traps (majority  of captures), decreases in abundance and species richness were observed from south to north along the fir forest transect, with evidence of decreasing specific diversity as measured by the Shannon index of diversity. Strong differences in species assemblages were also observed between the  southern maple and fir forest sites. The Silphidae and Histeridae were more abundant in the maple forest, whereas the Hydrophilidae and Ptilidae were more abundant in the fir forest.

20405791|t|Forest restoration in a mixed-ownership landscape under climate change.
20405791|a|The extent to which current landscapes deviate from the historical range of natural variability (RNV) is a common means of defining and ranking regional conservation targets. However, climate-induced shifts in forest composition may render obsolete restoration strategies and conservation targets based on historic climate conditions and disturbance regimes. We used a spatially explicit forest ecosystem model, LANDIS-II, to simulate the interaction of climate change and forest management in northeastern Minnesota, USA. We assessed the relevance of restoration strategies and conservation targets based on the RNV in the context of future climate change. Three climate scenarios (no climate change, low emissions, and high emissions) were simulated with three forest management scenarios: no harvest, current management, and a restoration-based approach where harvest activity mimicked the frequency, severity, and size distribution of historic natural disturbance regimes. Under climate change there was a trend toward homogenization of forest conditions due to the widespread expansion of systems dominated by maple (Acer spp.). White spruce (Picea glauca), balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) were extirpated from the landscape irrespective of management activity; additional losses of black spruce (P. mariana), red pine (Pinus resinosa), and jack pine (P. banksiana) were projected in the high-emissions scenario. In the restoration management scenario, retention and conversion to white pine (P. strobus) restricted maple expansion. But, widespread forest loss in the restoration scenario under high-emissions projections illustrates the potential pitfalls of implementing an RNV management approach in a system that is not compositionally similar to the historic reference condition. Given the uncertainty associated with climate change, ensuring a diversity of species and conditions within forested landscapes may be the most effective means of ensuring the future resistance of ecosystems to climate-induced declines in productivity.

19967982|t|Anti-insect secondary metabolites from fungal endophytes of conifer trees.
19967982|a|Choristoneura fumiferana is the most economically-important insect pest in eastern North America. Historically, strategies to control epidemics have relied on chemical pesticides that are no longer approved for use. The presence of fungal endophytes in cool area grass species and their role in reducing the impact of herbivorous insects is well understood. Recent work has demonstrated that foliar endophytes of conifers also produce anti-insect toxins. Field and nursery studies testing trees infected with the rugulosin producing endophyte Phialocephala scopiformis reduced the growth and development of C. fumiferana. The study of foliar endophytes from a variety of conifers including: Picea mariana, P. rubens and P. glauca as well as Abies balsamea and Larix laricina for the discovery of other anti-insect toxins are discussed. These endophytes are horizontally transmitted thus they are not present in nursery seedlings. Inoculating seedlings with toxigenic endophyte strains has been demonstrated to be effective in providing the tree with tolerance to herbivorous insects.

19938000|a|BACKGROUND: Spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.), causes cumulative defoliation and hence annual growth loss of the balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.) Mill, host tree. Annual growth increments of mixed balsam fir stands were measured by stem analysis over a 9 year period (1994-2002), when Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. kurstaki (Btk) was applied to control spruce budworm defoliation. With this approach, it was possible to quantify the change in stand volume growth after aerial spray applications of Btk. RESULTS: Differences between the periodic volume increment of protected and unprotected plots were statistically significant, while differences between protected and budworm-free plots were not significant. After 9 years, the difference in periodic increment between protected and unprotected plots was 20 m(3) ha(-1), and the difference in periodic mortality was 20.5 m(3) ha(-1). CONCLUSION: An economic assessment of Btk treatments indicates that biopesticide aerial spraying operations are justified, as they prevented substantial balsam fir mortality and growth losses over the 9 year study.

19203970|t|Wood formation in Abies balsamea seedlings subjected to artificial defoliation.
19203970|a|We determined the cambial sensitivity and quantified the anatomical differences in xylem of Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. seedlings subjected to artificial defoliation to simulate spruce budworm feeding. Defoliation was performed by removing two-thirds of needles of all current-year shoots for up to four consecutive growth cycles to account for inter- and intra-annual xylem formation. In Experiment 1, xylem development was studied from May to October 2005 in seedlings defoliated at the end of June. In Experiment 2, anatomical features of the xylem were measured along the tree rings formed in 2005 and 2006 during the four cycles of growth and defoliation. Control and defoliated seedlings showed similar patterns of cambial activity and timing of xylem differentiation, although fewer enlarging cells were observed in August to September in defoliated seedlings. Tree-ring widths were similar in control and defoliated seedlings, with thinner rings produced in the greenhouse in winter. No effect of defoliation on cell lumen area was observed, and effects on radial cell diameter and wall thickness were found only occasionally. The results indicate that the A. balsamea seedlings produced all the resources required to maintain stem growth during the four cycles of defoliation.

19203960|t|Seasonal changes in abundance and phosphorylation status of photosynthetic proteins in eastern white pine and balsam fir.
19203960|a|During winter, the light-harvesting complexes of evergreen plants change function from energy-harvesting to energy-dissipating centers. The goal of our study was to monitor changes in the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus that accompany these functional changes. Seasonal changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, pigment concentration, and abundance and phosphorylation status of photosynthetic proteins in Pinus strobus L. (sun-exposed trees) and Abies balsamea (L.) P. Mill. (sun-exposed and shaded trees) were examined in the cold winter climate of Minnesota. Results indicated typical seasonal changes in chlorophyll fluorescence and pigment concentration, with sustained reduced photosystem II (PSII) efficiency during winter, accompanied by retention of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin, and winter increases in the pool of xanthophyll cycle pigments and lutein. In sun-exposed trees, all photosynthetic proteins that were monitored decreased in relative abundance during winter, although two light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (Lhcb2 and Lhcb5), and the PsbS protein, were enriched in non-summer months, suggesting a role for these proteins in winter acclimation. In contrast, shaded trees maintained most of their protein throughout winter, with reductions occurring in spring. Thylakoid protein phosphorylation data suggest winter increases in the phosphorylation of a PSII core protein, PsbH, in sun-exposed trees, and increases in phosphorylation of all PSII core proteins in shaded trees.

18943849|t|Genetic Variability of Canadian Populations of the Sapstain Fungus Ophiostoma piceae.
18943849|a|ABSTRACT Genetic diversity was studied in seven Canadian populations of Ophiostoma piceae, the most prevalent sapstain fungus in Canadian softwoods. A total of 239 single-spore isolates were recovered following a systematic survey of sapstain fungi in logs and lumber at seven selected sawmills in six Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick). Sampling was carried out on five commercially important softwood species: balsam fir (Abies balsamea), white spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (Picea mariana), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and lodgepole pine (Pinus con-torta var. latifolia). The A and B mating types occurred at equal frequency (MAT A/ MAT B = 1.00:1.13) over all populations. Pseudo-allelic frequencies were estimated at each of 24 putative genetic loci by scoring for presence or absence of random amplified polymorphic DNA fragments generated by five primers. A total of 237 haplotypes were found among the 239 isolates, revealing a high level of genotypic diversity among isolates. Total gene diversity (H(T) = 0.414) was mostly attributable to diversity within populations (H(S) = 0.369). Thus, only 11.2% of the total variability was attributable to frequency differences among populations. An analysis of molecular variance revealed that most genetic variability occurred within subpopulations within mills (84.3%; P < 0.001), whereas low but statistically significant levels of genetic differentiation were also observed among subpopulations within populations (5.4%; P < 0.001) and among populations (10.3%; P < 0.001). Estimates of Nei' genetic distances were not correlated with geographic distances among sampling locations (r = -0.092; P = 0.310), although principal component analysis indicated that subpopulations located east of Saskatchewan were grouped on the same side of the second principal component axis. Overall, results suggest moderate genetic differentiation of O. piceae in Canada, which is consistent with the observation that sexual reproduction is frequently observed in this fungus.

18708643|t|Cambial activity and intra-annual xylem formation in roots and stems of Abies balsamea and Picea mariana.
18708643|a|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies on xylogenesis focus essentially on the stem, whereas there is basically no information about the intra-annual growth of other parts of the tree. As roots strongly influence carbon allocation and tree development, knowledge of the dynamics of xylem production and maturation in roots at a short time scale is required for a better understanding of the phenomenon of tree growth. This study compared cambial activity and xylem formation in stem and roots in two conifers of the boreal forest in Canada. METHODS: Wood microcores were collected weekly in stem and roots of ten Abies balsamea and ten Picea mariana during the 2004-2006 growing seasons. Cross-sections were cut using a rotary microtome, stained with cresyl violet acetate and observed under visible and polarized light. The number of cells in the cambial zone and in differentiation, plus the number of mature cells, was counted along the developing xylem. KEY RESULTS: Xylem formation lasted from the end of May to the end of September, with no difference between stem and roots in 2004-2005. On the contrary, in 2006 a 1-week earlier beginning of cell differentiation was observed in the stem, with cell wall thickening and lignification in roots ending up to 22 d later than in the stem. Cell production in the stem was concentrated early in the season, in June, while most cell divisions in roots occurred 1 month later. CONCLUSIONS: The intra-annual dynamics of growth observed in stem and roots could be related to the different amount of cells produced by the cambium and the patterns of air and soil temperature occurring in spring.

18519253|t|Ecophysiology and growth of advance red spruce and balsam fir regeneration after partial cutting in yellow birch-conifer stands.
18519253|a|We investigated ecophysiological and growth responses of short (0.4 to 1.3 m in height) advance regeneration of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea L.) six years after removal of 0, 40, 50, 60 and 100% of the overstory basal area (BA) in two yellow birch-conifer stands. Partial cuts significantly increased stomatal conductance of red spruce only. Light-saturated photosynthesis (leaf-area basis) of both species increased with BA removal, but unlike red spruce, specific leaf area (SLA) of balsam fir decreased with increased cutting intensity. Partial cuts appreciably increased the concentration of N and Ca in red spruce and balsam fir foliage, respectively, and resulted in decreased foliar concentrations of K in red spruce and Mg in balsam fir. The height and lateral growth of both species increased with BA removal, although partial cuts were more beneficial to balsam fir. The data suggest that short advance regeneration of red spruce and balsam fir can coexist under partial overstory conditions, but balsam fir has physiological characteristics and a capacity for morphological adjustment (SLA) that places it at an advantage when in competition with red spruce.

18450571|t|Springtime resumption of photosynthesis in balsam fir (Abies balsamea).
18450571|a|Photosynthesis in balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) was measured in the field at two locations in New Brunswick, Canada from late winter to late spring in 2004 and 2005. No photosynthesis was detectable while the soil remained below 0 degrees C throughout the rooting zone. In both years, photosynthesis began once soil temperature rose to 0 degrees C. In potted seedlings in growth chambers, there was no photosynthesis at an air temperature of 10 degrees C if the pots were frozen. These findings suggest that, once air temperatures permit photosynthesis, it is the availability of unfrozen soil water that triggers the onset of photosynthesis. In the field, full recovery of photosynthetic capacity following the onset of soil thaw was dependent on air temperature and took 5 weeks in 2005, but 10 weeks in 2004. There were two substantial frost events during the recovery period in 2004 that may explain the extended recovery period. In 2005, recovery was complete after the accumulation of 200 growing degree days above 0 degrees C after the start of soil thaw.

18058024|t|Element mobility and partitioning along a soil acidity gradient in central Ontario forests, Canada.
18058024|a|The potential environmental risk posed by metals in forest soils is typically evaluated by modeling metal mobility using soil-solution partitioning coefficients (K(d)), although such information is generally restricted to a few well-studied metals. Soil-solution partitioning coefficients were determined for 17 mineral elements (Al, As, Be, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, Li, Mg, Rb, Sr, Tl, U and V) in A-horizon (0-5 cm) soil at 46 forested sites that border the Precambrian Shield in central Ontario, where soil pH(aq) varied from 3.9 to 8.1. Sites were dominated by mature sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) or white pine (Pinus strobus L.). Log K(d) values for all elements could be predicted by empirical linear regression with soil pH (r(2) = 0.17-0.77) independent of forest type, although this relationship was greatly affected by positive relationships between acid-extractable metal concentration and pH(aq) for 13 of the 17 elements. Elements that exhibited strong or moderate (r(2) > 0.29; p < 0.001) relationships with soil pH(aq) in soil water extracts include Al, Ba, Fe, Ga, K, Li, Rb, Tl, V (negative) and Ca (positive). Elemental partitioning in mineral soil was independent of forest type; tree species differed in their response to chemical differences in mineral soil. For example, Rb, Ba, and Sr concentrations in foliage of sugar maple and white birch significantly increased with increasing soil acidity, whereas Rb, Ba, and Sr concentrations in balsam fir and white pine foliage exhibited no response to soil pH(aq). While K(d) values can provide useful information on the potential mobility and bioavailability of mineral elements in forest soils, care must be used when interpreting the relative contribution of solid and aqueous phases to this relationship and the differing responses of vegetation in elemental cycling in forests must also be considered.

17849882|t|Distribution and hosts of Callidiellum rufipenne (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), an asian cedar borer established in the eastern United States.
17849882|a|The distribution and hosts of the exotic cedar-boring beetle, Callidiellum rufipenne (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), were determined in five northeastern U.S. states by capturing adults on cedar trap logs and by rearing adults from various conifers. This beetle was detected in the coastal states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. In these states, adults emerged from the live or dead wood of four genera and eight species of Cupressaceae; species of Pinaceae were not hosts. Through its entire range, C. rufipenne is reported to infest at least 14 species of Cupressaceae, four species of Pinaceae, and one species of Taxaceae; but, records of Pinaceae and possibly Taxaceae are suspect. Based on the number of adults that emerged from coniferous poles in a five-way choice test in the field, the infestation level was significantly greater in Chamaecyparis thyoides (L.) Britton, Sterns, and Poggenburg and Juniperus virginiana L. than in Pinus rigida Miller, Pinus strobus L., and Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carribre (last three species uninfested). In a second test of host preference in the wild, beetles infested four cupressaceous species, but not Abies balsamea (L.) Miller, Picea rubens Sargent, Pinus rigida, P. strobus, and Ts. canadensis in the Pinaceae. Infestation level was highest in Ch. thyoides, followed in decreasing order by Juniperus communis L., Thuja occidentalis L., and J. virginiana. In a comparison of live and dead J. virginiana, beetles developed to adults only in dead trees (36 beetles per tree). When trunk sections of Th. occidentalis with and without bark were offered to females in cages, beetles of the next generation emerged exclusively from wood with bark. In the Northeast, only species of Cupressaceae apparently are suitable hosts for C. rufipenne. Infestation of these species may be prevented or reduced by proper care of live plants and by debarking trees after harvesting.

21636443|t|Reproductive potential of balsam fir (Abies balsamea), white spruce (Picea glauca), and black spruce (P. mariana) at the ecotone between mixedwood and coniferous forests in the boreal zone of western Quebec.
21636443|a|The reproductive potentials of balsam fir and white spruce (co-dominants in mixedwood forests) and black spruce (dominant in coniferous forests) were studied to explain the location of the ecotone between the two forest types in the boreal zone of Quebec. Four sites were selected along a latitudinal gradient crossing the ecotone. Cone crop, number of seeds per cone, percentage filled seeds, and percentage germination were measured for each species. Balsam fir and white spruce cone crops were significantly lower in the coniferous than in the mixedwood forest, while black spruce had greater crop constancy and regularity between both forest types. Mast years were more frequent for black spruce than for balsam fir in both forest types (mast year data not available for white spruce). The number of seeds per cone was more related to cone size than to forest type for all species. Black spruce produced more filled seeds in the coniferous forest than balsam fir or white spruce. The sum of growing degree-days and the maximum temperature of the warmest month (both for the year prior to cone production) significantly affected balsam fir cone production. The climate-related northward decrease in reproductive potential of balsam fir and white spruce could partly explain the position of the northern limit of the mixedwood forest. This could change drastically, however, as the ongoing climate warming might cancel this competitive advantage of black spruce.

17169902|t|Interannual consistency in canopy stomatal conductance control of leaf water potential across seven tree species.
17169902|a|We investigated interannual variability of canopy transpiration per unit ground area (E (C)) and per unit leaf area (E (L)) across seven tree species in northern Wisconsin over two years. These species have previously been shown to be sufficient to upscale stand-level transpiration to the landscape level during one growing season. Our objective was to test whether a simple plant hydraulic model could capture interannual variation in transpiration. Three species, wetland balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill), basswood (Tilia Americana L.) and speckled alder (Alnus rugosa (DuRoi) Spreng), had no change in E (C) or E (L) between 2000 and 2001. Red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait) had a 57 and 19% increase in E (C) and E (L), respectively, and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh) had an 83 and 41% increase in E (C) and E (L), respectively, from 2000 to 2001. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx) had a 50 and 21% decrease in E (C) and E (L), respectively, from 2000 to 2001 in response to complete defoliation by forest tent caterpillar (Malascoma distria Huber) and subsequent lower total leaf area index of the reflushed foliage. White cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) had a 20% decrease in both E (C) and E (L) caused by lowered surface water in wetlands in 2001 because of lower precipitation and wetland flow management. Upland A. balsamea increased E (L) and E (C) by 55 and 53%, respectively, as a result of release from light competition of the defoliated, overstory P. tremuloides. We hypothesized that regardless of different drivers of interannual variability in E (C) and E (L), minimum leaf water potential would be regulated at the same value. Minimum midday water potentials were consistent over the two years within each of the seven species despite large changes in transpiration between years. This regulation was independently verified by the exponential saturation between daily E (C) and vapor pressure deficit (D) and the tradeoff between a reference canopy stomatal conductance (G (S)) and the sensitivity of G (S) to D, indicating that trees with high G (S) must decrease G (S) in response to atmospheric drought faster than trees with low G (S). Our results show that models of forest canopy transpiration can be simplified by incorporating G (S) regulation of minimum leaf water potential for isohydric species.

17064264|t|Diversity of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonizing Clintonia borealis from a mixed-wood boreal forest.
17064264|a|Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities in Clintonia borealis roots from a boreal mixed forests in northwestern Quebec were investigated. Roots were sampled from 100 m2 plots whose overstory was dominated by either trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), or mixed white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Part of the 18S ribosomal gene of the AMF was amplified and the resulting PCR products were cloned. Restriction analysis of the 576 resulting clones yielded 92 different restriction patterns which were then sequenced. Fifty-two sequences closely matched other Glomus sequences from Genbank. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 different AMF sequence types, most of which clustered with other uncultured AM sequences from plant roots from various field sites. Compared with other AMF communities from comparable studies, richness and diversity were higher than observed in an arable field, but lower than seen in a tropical forest and a temperate wetland. The AMF communities from Clintonia roots under the different canopy types did not differ significantly and the dominant sequence type, which clustered with AM sequences from a variety of environments and hosts at distant geographical locations, represented 66.9% of all the clones analyzed.

17057985|t|Paleoecological assessment of watershed history in PRIMENet watersheds at Acadia National Park, USA.
17057985|a|Paleoecological reconstructions of forest stand histories for two upland watersheds at Acadia National Park in Maine were completed to support related watershed chemistry studies. The project hypothesis was that forest type and fire history influence long-term cycling and storage of atmospheric mercury and nitrogen within watersheds. The reconstructions document differences in major vegetation composition and disturbance between the burned and unburned watersheds during the past several centuries. Pollen and charcoal stratigraphies from organic sediment accumulations in forested wet depressions indicate that the present experimental design of contrasting disturbance and forest histories has persisted during recent centuries. The unburned watershed has been dominated by spruce (Picea rubens) and fir (Abies balsamea) for 500 years or more and has not recently burned or been substantially cleared. The burned watershed is dominated by a heterogeneous forest of patchy hardwood, mixed wood, and softwood stands. A large portion of this watershed burned severely in 1947 and probably more than once in the 1800s, and has supported heterogeneous successional forests for 200 years or longer. Overall, these results support the underlying premise that the experimental design of this watershed research can be used to infer landscape controls on biogeochemical processes.

16995632|t|Forest dynamics after successive spruce budworm outbreaks in mixedwood forests.
16995632|a|In order to assess the long-term spatiotemporal influence of the spruce budworm in sub-boreal mixedwood forests, we studied the effect of three successive outbreaks in a region of western Quebec, Canada. We used dendrochronology to detect past outbreaks in three areas (111-185 ha), based on the recruitment age of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and on growth patterns of white spruce (Picea glauca), the two main host species of this defoliating insect. We also used a series of aerial photographs taken between 1935 and 2003 to evaluate overstory mortality and post-outbreak succession patterns in these same areas. Individual outbreaks had a spatially homogenous impact on host species throughout the region, but successive outbreaks differed in intensity: the two outbreaks around 1910 and 1980 caused widespread mortality in the overstory, but an outbreak around 1945 had little impact, probably because the forest mosaic had not yet recuperated from the 1910 outbreak. No clear outbreak was detected in the later part of the 19th century. In portions of the study areas where the 1910 outbreak had a major impact, between 36% and 50% of the stands were reoccupied by balsam fir stands in the period up to the 1980 outbreak (cyclic succession), the rest being at least partly replaced by nonhost species such as Betula spp. Changes in forest composition after the 1910 outbreak were mostly associated with upper-slope positions in all study areas. The 1980 outbreak also had a higher impact than earlier outbreaks in lower-slope positions dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana)-balsam fir mixtures. These results suggest that, at the regional scale, the abundance of mature or over-mature balsam fir stands does not determine the outbreak cycle. When an outbreak occurs, however, its impact will be strongly constrained by forest characteristics such as stand composition and structure, which are themselves influenced by previous disturbances and slope position.

16699911|t|Relationships between stand composition and ectomycorrhizal community structure in boreal mixed-wood forests.
16699911|a|We investigated the community structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi under varying overstory tree compositions in the southern mixed-wood boreal forest of Quebec. Sampling took place at two locations of differing postfire ages and nine 100-m2 plots were sampled per location. The dominant overstory tree species in the plots were trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) or white spruce [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss], and balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.]. Mycorrhizae were analyzed using morphological as well as molecular methods, employing fungal-specific primers to amplify ribosomal DNA for subsequent cloning and sequencing. A total of 1800 mycorrhizal root tips collected from the 18 plots were morphologically classified into 26 morphotypes, with Cenococcum geophilum dominating (36% of root tips). A second set of root tips, selected from the same 18 samples on which the morphological analysis was based, were analyzed using molecular methods. From this analysis, 576 cloned polymerase chain reaction products were screened by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and a total of 207 unique types were found. No one type dominated the system and 159 occurred only once. Sequence analysis of the types that occurred more than once revealed that Piloderma sp., Russula sp., Cortinarius sp., and Lactarius sp. were the most common mycorrhizae. The ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure revealed by the rDNA analysis differed from that observed using morphological methods. Canonical correspondence analyses of the sequenced restriction types and % overstory composition indicate that the distributions of ectomycorrhizal fungi are influenced by the relative proportions of host tree species. The distinct fungal assemblages found in the different plots supported by the different combinations of host tree species provides further support for the need to conserve stand diversity in the southern boreal forest.

16619365|t|Composition and antibacterial activity of Abies balsamea essential oil.
16619365|a|The antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Abies balsamea (balsam fir) was evaluated against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The essential oil of A. balsamea was found to be inactive against E. coli (>100 microg/mL) and active against S. aureus, with an MIC of 56 microg/mL. The oil composition was analysed by GC-MS and the antibacterial activity of each oil constituent was determined. The essential oil of A. balsamea is essentially constituted of monoterpenes (>96%) and some sesquiterpenes. beta-pinene (29.9%), delta-3-carene (19.6%) and alpha-pinene (14.6%) were the major components. beta-pinene and delta-3-carene were found inactive against both bacteria strains. However, three constituents of the essential oil were active against S. aureus: alpha-pinene, beta-caryophyllene (0.4%) and alpha-humulene (0.2%) with MIC values of 13.6 microg/mL, 5.1 microg/mL and 2.6 microg/mL, respectively.

16585037|t|Dark respiration rate increases with plant size in saplings of three temperate tree species despite decreasing tissue nitrogen and nonstructural carbohydrates.
16585037|a|In shaded environments, minimizing dark respiration during growth could be an important aspect of maintaining a positive whole-plant net carbon balance. Changes with plant size in both biomass distribution to different tissue types and mass-specific respiration rates (R(d)) of those tissues would have an impact on whole-plant respiration. In this paper, we evaluated size-related variation in R(d), biomass distribution, and nitrogen (N) and total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations of leaves, stems and roots of three cold-temperate tree species (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill, Acer rubrum L. and Pinus strobus L.) in a forest understory. We sampled individuals varying in age (6 to 24 years old) and in size (from 2 to 500 g dry mass), and growing across a range of irradiances (from 1 to 13% of full sun) in northern Minnesota, USA. Within each species, we found small changes in R(d), N and TNC when comparing plants growing across this range of light availability. Consistent with our hypotheses, as plants grew larger, whole-plant N and TNC concentrations in all species declined as a result of a combination of changes in tissue N and shifts in biomass distribution patterns. However, contrary to our hypotheses, whole-plant and tissue R(d) increased with plant size in the three species.

15996964|t|Carbon and biomass partitioning in balsam fir (Abies balsamea).
15996964|a|Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill) was extensively sampled to investigate the effects of forest management practices, site location, within-crown position, tree component (i.e., stem, foliage, branches and roots), and tree social classes on biomass and carbon (C) partitioning at the individual tree level and across ecological regions. The sites were located in three ecologically distinct forest regions of west-central New Brunswick, Canada. There were no significant differences in %C content of trees across ecological regions or across tree social classes. However, at the individual tree level, significant differences were evident in biomass and C allocation between different parts of the tree, between treatment types (i.e., unmanaged and pre-commercially thinned stands) and between within-crown positions, indicating the need for separate estimates of biomass and C content of tree components to obtain more precise estimates of quantities at the stand level. Calculating stand C content based on constant allocation values, as is commonly done, produced errors of up to 15% compared with the values calculated in this study. Three allometric equations of biomass and C that account for partitioning among different parts of the tree were developed and compared: (1) a third-order polynomial, (2) a modified inverse polynomial and (3) a modified Weibull equation. Diameter at breast height (DBH) was used as the only explanatory variable to describe fresh biomass, dry biomass and C content. All regressions derived showed a high correlation with DBH, with most r2 values > 0.95. A comparison of the equation results showed that the modified Weibull equation gave consistent results with the best overall fit and was the simplest of the three equations investigated. The regressions can be used to estimate forest biomass and tree C content at the stand level, given specific information on DBH.

30795471|t|Crown Rot of Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis Caused by Phytophthora cactorum in Virginia.
30795471|a|In early July 2004, a severe crown rot of Canaan fir (Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis Fern.) was reported to the Virginia Cooperative Extension, Frederick County Office, and subsequently to the Virginia Tech Disease Clinic in Virginia Beach. One thousand five-year-old Canaan fir transplants (approximately 11 mm in caliper and 31 cm high) had been purchased from a tree nursery in Oregon and planted in the field in Frederick County, VA, in April of 2004. The field site had not been cultivated for 4 years after an apple orchard had been removed in 2000. By mid-May, needle browning had become serious, affecting the lower crown first. By August, transplants had suffered 40% mortality. Basal stems of affected plants were obviously discolored. Root and basal stem samples from several infected plants were then cultured on PARP-V8 agar on three different dates. Phytophthora sp. isolates were recovered from all stem samples but none from the roots. These isolates produced a large number of papillate sporangia that were caducous with short pedicels. Abundant oogonia with paragynous antheridia formed oospores directly on isolation plates within 7 days. The isolates were keyed as P. cactorum (2). This identification was confirmed using a single-strand-conformation polymorphism analysis of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-1 (4). It appears that the source of inoculum was P. cactorum associated with the previous apple crop, since Canaan fir from the same transplant lot planted in a nearby field without a history of apples remained healthy. P. cactorum has been reported to cause root rot of noble fir (A. procera Rhedo), Pacific silver fir (A. amabilis (Dougl.) Forbes), and Shasta red fir (A. magnifica var. shastensis Lemm.) in the Pacific Northwest (3). It has also caused crown rot of Fraser fir (A. fraseri (Pursh) Poir.), noble fir, white fir (A. concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl.), and balsam fir (A. balsamea (L.) Mill.) in Michigan (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. cactorum attacking Canaan fir. Canaan fir currently is a recommended Christmas tree species for areas where Fraser fir does not do well due to root rot caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi. This study suggests that such a recommendation must be used with caution. Growing Canaan fir trees in P. cactorum-infested soil could result in devastating crop losses as reported in this note.

15701398|t|Epiphytic lichen diversity on dead and dying conifers under different levels of atmospheric pollution.
15701398|a|Based on literature data, epiphytic lichen abundance was comparably studied in montane woodlands on healthy versus dead or dying conifers of Europe and North America in areas with different levels of atmospheric pollution. Study sites comprised Picea abies forests in the Harz Mountains and in the northern Alps, Germany, Picea rubens-Abies balsamea forests on Whiteface Mountain, Adirondacks, New York, U.S.A. and Picea engelmannii-Abies lasiocarpa forests in the Salish Mountains, Montana, U.S.A. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that epiphytic lichen vegetation differed more between healthy and dead or dying trees at high- versus low-polluted sites. This is attributed to greater differences in chemical habitat conditions between trees of different vitality in highly polluted areas. Based on these results, a hypothetical model of relative importance of site factors for small-scale variation of epiphytic lichen abundance versus atmospheric pollutant load is discussed.

15631985|t|Interacting influence of light and size on aboveground biomass distribution in sub-boreal conifer saplings with contrasting shade tolerance.
15631985|a|Plant size often influences shade tolerance but relatively few studies have considered the functional response of taller plants to contrasting light environments. Several boreal and sub-boreal Abies, Picea and Pinus species were studied along a light (0-90% full sunlight) and size (30-400-cm high) gradient to examine the interactive influence of tree size and light availability on aboveground biomass distribution. Sampling was conducted in two regions of Canada: (A) British Columbia, for Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt., the Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss x P. engelmannii Parry ex. Engelm. complex and Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.; and (B) Quebec, for Abies balsamea (L.) Mill., Picea glauca (Moench. Voss) and Pinus banksiana (Lamb.). All biomass distribution traits investigated varied with size, and most showed a significant interaction with both size and light, which resulted in increasing divergences among light classes as size increased. For example, the proportion of needle mass decreased as size increased but the rate of decrease was much greater in saplings growing at below 10% full sunlight. Needle area ratio (total needle area:aboveground mass) followed a similar pattern, but decreased more rapidly with increasing tree size for small trees up to 1 m tall. The proportion of needle biomass (needle mass ratio) was always lower in taller trees (i.e., > 1 m tall) than in small trees (< 1 m tall) and increasingly so at the lowest solar irradiances (0-10% full sunlight). Thus, extrapolating the functional response to light from small seedling to taller individuals is not always appropriate.

15568352|t|Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki aerial spray prescriptions for balsam fir stand protection against spruce budworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).
15568352|a|Although commercial formulations of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) are being widely used in forest protection against lepidopteran defoliators, optimal application prescriptions have often yet to be worked out in detail. We conducted field experiments over a 6-yr period (1996-2001) in southwestern Quebec to determine application prescriptions for optimal protection of balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.), healthy stands against the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). At moderate larval densities (<30 larvae per 45-cm branch tip), similar foliage protection was achieved with one or two Btk applications of 30 billion international units per hectare (BIU/ha). When larval densities exceeded 30 larvae per branch tip, two successive applications of 30 BIU/ha significantly increased foliage protection. Whether the second application took place 5 or 10 d after the first spray did not affect treatment efficacy. Increasing the application dosage from 30 to 50 BIU/ha did not lead to better foliage protection against high larval densities, but the current standard dosage of 30 BIU/ha saved more foliage than 15 BIU/ha against moderate populations. The recommended dosage of 30 BIU can be applied in lower application volumes (1.5 liters/ha) by using a high-potency product (20 BIU/liter), because we did not observe a reduction in efficacy compared with the application of a lower potency product (12.7 BIU/liter) in 2.37 liters/ha. We also demonstrated that Btk can be applied much earlier in the season without compromising spray efficacy: there was no difference in treatment efficacy of double applications at 30 BIU/ha when the first spray was timed for early third, peak third, or early fourth instars.

15058396|t|The influence of top-down, bottom-up and abiotic factors on the moose (Alces alces) population of Isle Royale.
15058396|a|Long-term, concurrent measurement of population dynamics and associated top-down and bottom-up processes are rare for unmanipulated, terrestrial systems. Here, we analyse populations of moose, their predators (wolves, Canis lupus), their primary winter forage (balsam fir, Abies balsamea) and several climatic variables that were monitored for 40 consecutive years in Isle Royale National Park (544 km2), Lake Superior, USA. We judged the relative importance of top-down, bottom-up and abiotic factors on moose population growth rate by constructing multiple linear regression models, and calculating the proportion of interannual variation in moose population growth rate explained by each factor. Our analysis indicates that more variation in population growth rate is explained by bottom-up than top-down processes, and abiotic factors explain more variation than do bottom-up processes. Surprisingly, winter precipitation did not explain any significant variation in population growth rate. Like that detected for two Norwegian ungulate populations, the relationship between population growth rate and the North Atlantic Oscillation was nonlinear. Although this analysis provides significant insight, much remains unknown: of the models examined, the most parsimonious explain little more than half the variation in moose population growth rate.

14994805|t|Design and evaluation of an aerial spray trial with true replicates to test the efficacy of Bacillus thuringiensis insecticide in a boreal forest.
14994805|a|A field trial using true replicates was conducted successfully in a boreal forest in 1996 to evaluate the efficacy of two aerially applied Bacillus thuringiensis formulations, ABG 6429 and ABG 6430. A complete randomized design with four replicates per treatment was chosen. Twelve to 15 balsam fir (Abies balsamea [L.] Mill.) per plot were randomly selected as sample trees. Interplot buffer zones, > or = 200 m wide, adequately prevented cross contamination from sprays that were atomized with four rotary atomizers (volume median diameters ranging from 64.6 to 139.4 microm) and released approximately 30 m above the ground. The B. thuringiensis formulations were not significantly different (P > 0.05) from each other in reducing spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [Clem.]) populations and protecting balsam trees from defoliation but both formulations were significantly more efficacious than the controls. The results suggest that true replicates are a feasible alternative to pseudoreplication in experimental forest aerial applications.

14757581|t|Seasonal and annual changes in soil respiration in relation to soil temperature, water potential and trenching.
14757581|a|Soil respiration (rs), soil temperature (Ts) and volumetric soil water content were measured in a balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) ecosystem from 1998 to 2001. Seasonal variation in root and microbial respiration, and covariation in abiotic factors confounded interpretation of the effects of Ts and soil water potential (Psis) on rs. To minimize the confounding effect of temperature, we analyzed the effect of Psis on rs during the summers of 1998-2000 when changes in Ts were slight. Soil respiration declined 25-50% in response to modest water stress (minimum Psis of -0.6 to -0.2 MPa), and between years, there was substantial variation in the relationship between rs and Psis. In the summer of 2000, 2-m2 plots were subjected to drought for 1 month and other plots were irrigated. The relationship between summertime rs and Psis in the experimental plots was similar to that estimated from the survey data obtained during the same summer. In late spring and early autumn of 2001, 2-m2 trenched and untrenched plots were subjected to drought or exposed to rainfall. It was dry in the early autumn and there was severe soil drying (Psis of -10 MPa in untrenched plots and -2 MPa in trenched plots). In spring, rs in untrenched plots responded more to modest water stress than rs in trenched plots, indicating that root respiration is more sensitive than microbial respiration to water stress at this time of year. The response to abiotic factors differed significantly between spring and autumn in untrenched plots but not in trenched plots, indicating that root activity was greater in early autumn than in late spring, and that roots acclimated to the sustained, severe water stress experienced before and during the autumn.

12802719|t|Antitumor activity of balsam fir oil: production of reactive oxygen species induced by alpha-humulene as possible mechanism of action.
12802719|a|The antitumor activity of the essential oil of Abies balsamea (balsam fir oil) was evaluated against several solid tumor cell lines including MCF-7, PC-3, A-549, DLD-1, M4BEU and CT-26. Balsam fir oil was found to be active against all the solid tumor cell lines tested, with GI 50 values ranging between 0.76 and 1.7 mg/mL. The oil was analyzed by GC-MS and the cytotoxicity of each oil constituent was determined. Balsam fir oil is essentially constituted of monoterpenes tau; 96 %) and some sesquiterpenes. All the compounds tested were inactive (tau; 250 microM) except for alpha-humulene (GI50 = 55 to 73 microM) which thus seems responsible for the cytotoxicity of the oil. We also tested the cytotoxicity of caryophyllene oxide, which proved inactive, and gamma-caryophyllene which was found to be active against all solid tumor cell lines tested. We evaluated the effects of balsam fir oil and alpha-humulene on the cellular glutathione (GSH) content and on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Balsam fir oil and alpha-humulene induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cellular GSH content and an increase in ROS production. These results suggest that GSH depletion and ROS production may be implicated in the cytotoxicity of alpha-humulene and balsam fir oil.

12721829|t|Advantages of a mixed diet: feeding on several foliar age classes increases the performance of a specialist insect herbivore.
12721829|a|Two field studies were carried out to determine the influence of Abies balsamea foliage age on the preference and performance of larvae of Neodiprion abietis, a specialist Diprionid sawfly. Preference was determined by examining N. abietis defoliation on all age classes of foliage. Performance was estimated using larval survival, cocoon weights and the percentage of adults that were females. Neodiprion abietis preference for, and performance on, current-year foliage was very low, peaked on 2 or 3-year-old foliage, and declined on older foliage. Thus, sawfly feeding preference was adaptive. However, survival and cocoon weight were highest when sawflies were allowed to feed on all age classes of foliage, demonstrating that an insect specialist may perform better when feeding on several age classes of foliage from a single host plant species. These results indicate that either different larval instars have different nutritional requirements, or that food mixing provides the best diet, permitting the herbivore to obtain needed nutrients while avoiding ingestion of toxic doses of secondary metabolites. In addition, our results suggest that limited availability of varied foliage has more negative consequences for N. abietis females than for males, as the percentage of survivors that were females decreased when juvenile mortality was high. Our results emphasize the importance of considering non-linear changes in foliar quality as leaves age on herbivore preference and performance, and demonstrate how a herbivore can use this variability to maximize its fitness.

12651363|t|Ethylene evolution, radial growth and carbohydrate concentrations in Abies balsamea shoots ringed with Ethrel.
12651363|a|The terminal (1-year-old) shoot of quiescent, 2-year-old Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. seedlings was either left untreated or ringed with 0, 1 or 10 mg Ethrel g(-1) lanolin. After 5 weeks of culture under environmental conditions favorable for growth, the shoots were harvested to measure ethylene evolution and carbohydrate concentrations by gas chromatography, and tracheid number and bark radial width by microscopy. In untreated shoots, the basal rate of ethylene evolution followed the order: cambial region > cortex + periderm = xylem + pith = needles. Wound-induced ethylene production was not detected until at least 4 h after excision, but was evident in all fractions 24 h after excision; the increase in wound-induced ethylene evolution followed the order: cambial region > cortex + periderm > xylem + pith > needles. Compared with untreated controls, the application of plain lanolin, which involved the removal of needles and periderm, increased bark radial width and wound-induced ethylene production by the cambial region and the cortex + periderm, but decreased cambial region concentrations of fructose, glucose and starch at the application point. At the application point, Ethrel concomitantly increased ethylene evolution from the cambial region and the cortex + periderm, tracheid number, bark radial width, and the cambial region concentrations of fructose, glucose, sucrose and starch. No effects of Ethrel treatment were detected above or below the application point, with the exception that the 10 mg g(-1) Ethrel treatment stimulated ethylene evolution and decreased starch concentration of the cambial region. The results indicate that: (1) the cambial region is the major source of endogenous ethylene in the 1-year-old shoot; (2) the magnitude of the difference in ethylene evolution between particular shoot fractions is different before and after the start of wound-induced ethylene production; (3) the Ethrel-induced increase in tracheid number and bark radial width at the application point is positively related to ethylene evolution from the cambial region and the cortex + periderm, respectively; and (4) ethylene derived from Ethrel applied laterally to a woody stem can mobilize carbohydrates to the application point.

12109479|t|Mercury levels in lichens from different host trees around a chlor-alkali plant in New Brunswick, Canada.
12109479|a|Mercury concentrations were determined in the epiphytic lichen Hypogymnia physodes along five transects starting from a chlor-alkali plant located at Dalhousie, New Brunswick, a landfill site and a nearby electricity generating station. Lichen samples were collected from white birch (Betula papyrifera) and spruce (Picea sp.) or balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Average lichen background mercury values were 0.088+/-0.005 microg/g from white birch and 0.148+/-0.046 microg/g from spruce trees, with a detection limit of 0.05 microg/g. The chlor-alkali plant and a power plant were identified, respectively, as a major source and a minor source of elevated mercury levels in lichens. At 125 m north-west of the New Brunswick Power plant, 0.28 microg/g Hg were found in Hypogymnia physodes from spruce trees, while at 250 m west (downwind) of the chlor-alkali plant, 3.66 microg/g of mercury were determined. High values, 0.98 microg/g in lichens from spruce trees and 0.79 microg/g in lichen samples from white birch were also measured at 125 m south of the chlor-alkali plant and decreased exponentially with distance. The sphere of influence of the chlor-alkali plant with respect to mercury deposition was estimated to extend 2.4-3.4 km from the plant. The mercury concentrations in Hypogymnia physodes collected from white birch were significantly lower than the concentrations in the same lichen from spruce trees in areas with elevated levels of mercury, but not in areas with low mercury levels. The magnitude of this difference dropped with distance from the source.

28547290|t|The relationship between tree height and leaf area: sapwood area ratio.
28547290|a|The leaf area to sapwood area ratio (A l:A s) of trees has been hypothesized to decrease as trees become older and taller. Theory suggests that A l:A s must decrease to maintain leaf-specific hydraulic sufficiency as path length, gravity, and tortuosity constrain whole-plant hydraulic conductance. We tested the hypothesis that A l:A s declines with tree height. Whole-tree A l:A s was measured on 15 individuals of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) ranging in height from 13 to 62 m (aged 20-450 years). A l:A s declined substantially as height increased (P=0.02). Our test of the hypothesis that A l:A s declines with tree height was extended using a combination of original and published data on nine species across a range of maximum heights and climates. Meta-analysis of 13 whole-tree studies revealed a consistent and significant reduction in A l:A s with increasing height (P<0.05). However, two species (Picea abies and Abies balsamea) exhibited an increase in A l:A s with height, although the reason for this is not clear. The slope of the relationship between A l:A s and tree height (DeltaA l:A s/Deltah) was unrelated to mean annual precipitation. Maximum potential height was positively correlated with DeltaA l:A s/Deltah. The decrease in A l:A s with increasing tree size that we observed in the majority of species may be a homeostatic mechanism that partially compensates for decreased hydraulic conductance as trees grow in height.

12020367|t|Does nutrition-related stress carry over to spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) progeny?
12020367|a|Three different patterns of feeding of sixth-instar spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens were simulated in the laboratory. Larvae were fed artificial diets whose nitrogen and total soluble sugar contents varied according to levels similar to those found in three types of balsam fir, Abies balsamea (L.) Miller foliage (current-year foliage from middle and lower crown sections and one-year-old foliage). The biological performance of offspring was studied according to the nutrition of their parents. Although food quality had no impact on pupal weight of female parents and individual mean egg weight, progeny fitness was influenced by parental nutrition. Old foliage simulated diet, poor in nitrogen, clearly affected the early larval development of progeny, especially the percent of egg hatch and first-instar survival. Lower crown current-year foliage simulated diet, with low total soluble sugar content, reduced the first-instar survival of the progeny. However, the selective pressure exerted by low food qualities on the parental generation and on the early stages of their progenies resulted in C. fumiferana populations having higher tolerance to starvation and higher survival after the diapause period. These results highlighted the potentially direct and indirect effects of C. fumiferana parental nutrition on the next generation. The patterns of feeding of parental generations would appear to affect the quality and size of subsequent populations through several selections on the different life-history stages of both generations.

11986053|t|Changes in foliar spectral reflectance and chlorophyll fluorescence of four temperate species following branch cutting.
11986053|a|Spectral reflectance and chlorophyll fluorescence are rapid non-invasive methods that can be used to quantify plant stress. Because variation in ambient light (e.g., diurnal patterns of solar radiation) may have a confounding effect on these measurements, branches are often excised in the field and then measured under controlled conditions in the laboratory. We studied four temperate tree species (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. (balsam fir), Betula papyrifera var. cordifolia (Regel) Fern. (paper birch), Picea rubens Sarg. (red spruce) and Sorbus americana Marsh. (mountain-ash)) to determine how quickly reflectance and fluorescence change following branch cutting. We hypothesized that conifer species, which have tough xeromorphic foliage, would exhibit changes more slowly than broadleaf species. Furthermore, we hypothesized that keeping broadleaf samples cool and moist would delay the onset of reflectance and fluorescence changes. In one set of experiments, we did not use any treatments to maintain the freshness of cut branches. During the first 12 h following cutting, changes in reflectance and fluorescence were slight for all species. Two or 3 days after branch cutting, the two conifers still showed only small changes in the ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and most reflectance indices, whereas paper birch and mountain-ash showed larger and more rapid declines in Fv/Fm and most reflectance indices. We attribute these declines to loss of water. As a consequence of xeromorphic leaf structure, the conifers were better able to minimize water loss than the two broadleaf species. In another experiment, paper birch that had been kept cool and moist after cutting showed only slight changes in fluorescence and reflectance, even after 3 days, indicating that with careful handling the time interval between collection and measurement of reflectance and fluorescence of many broadleaf specimens can be extended to several days. We conclude that measurements of reflectance and fluorescence need not be made in situ to be accurate and reliable.

21665678|t|Genetic variation and population structure in central and isolated populations of balsam fir, Abies balsamea (Pinaceae).
21665678|a|Genetic variation and spatial genetic structure in balsam fir (Abies balsamea) were examined in two isolated populations in Iowa and Minnesota thought to be paleorefugia and in two ecologically central populations in old-growth forests of Upper Michigan. Overall levels of genetic variability at 22 allozyme loci were lower than that found in most conifer species (H(o) values ranged from 0.005 in the isolated populations to 0.025 in the central populations). The mean F(IS) value (0.154) was larger than usually found in conifers and suggests moderate levels of inbreeding. The mean F(ST), an estimate of genetic diversity among populations, was 3.7% of the total diversity, a value lower than the mean for conifers. Nm, the number of migrants per generation, was 6.5, suggesting either some gene flow among populations or a lack of genetic differentiation. Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed a moderately patchy structure, with gene flow distances of 30-70 m in the central populations and at least 10 m in the isolated populations. The future of the ecologically central populations depends on maintenance of an intact forest mosaic. The low genetic variability in the small, isolated populations suggests that habitat fragmentation has led to a reduction in evolutionary potential and that the future viability of these populations will likely require active management in the face of global climate change.

11960755|t|Gravimorphism in current-year shoots of Abies balsamea: involvement of compensatory growth, indole-3-acetic acid transport and compression wood formation.
11960755|a|We investigated the cause of gravimorphic growth inhibition in current-year shoots of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) seedlings displaced from their normal orientation in the gravitational field. Tilting the main stem of seedlings decreased shoot elongation, cambial growth as measured by tracheid production, and leaf dry weight of the terminal shoot and the lateral shoots on the lower side of the tilted stem. Removing either the terminal shoot or all lateral shoots induced compensatory growth in the remaining shoots, but did not reduce the inhibitory effect of tilting on shoot growth. Bending the apical part of a tilted main stem to restore it to the vertical did not fully reverse the inhibition of terminal shoot growth caused by stem tilting. Stem tilting inhibited cambial activity at the base of decapitated terminal shoots treated apically with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and decreased the basipetal transport of a [1-(14)C]-IAA pulse. Stem tilting also induced compression wood formation on the lower side of the tilted stem. Compression wood formation was associated with increases in cambial activity and stem respiration. Stem tilting did not affect either the net photosynthetic rate in 1-year-old leaves or the xylem water potential in current-year lateral shoots. These results support the hypothesis that gravimorphic growth inhibition in a current-year shoot on a tilted stem involves reductions in (1) the shoot's capacity to export IAA, and hence to mobilize photoassimilates, and (2) the supply of photoassimilates available for import by the shoot, as a result of increased cambial sink activity associated with compression wood formation outside that shoot.

11829646|t|Fate of spinosad in litter and soils of a mixed conifer stand in the Acadian forest region of New Brunswick.
11829646|a|Spinosad is a natural insecticide, produced via fermentation culture of the actinomycete Saccharopolyspora spinosa, with potential use against a number of forest pests including spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana [Clem]). Persistence of spinosad was determined in terrestrial fate experiments conducted within a semimature stand of black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.]) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea [L]) in the Acadian forest region of New Brunswick, Canada. Results of experiments established under full coniferous canopy and in a canopy opening indicated that spinosad dissipated rapidly following hyperbolic kinetics in both litter and soils and was not susceptible to leaching. Time to 50% dissipation estimates for spinosyn A ranged from 2.0 to 12.4 days depending upon matrix and experimental conditions. Spinosyn D dissipated to levels below quantitation limits (0.02 microg/g of dry mass) within 7 days in all cases. Sporadic low-level detection of the demethylated metabolites suggested that parent compounds were degraded in situ.

28547020|t|Testing the ecophysiological basis for the control of monoterpene concentrations in thinned and unthinned balsam fir stands across different drainage classes.
28547020|a|Stand thinning across different soil drainage types was used to test the ecophysiological basis for the control of foliar monoterpenes in current-year foliage of balsam trees [Abies balsamea (L.) P. Mill.] the year following treatment. Photosynthetic capacity (A max) was greater on mesic sites than on sub-hygric and hydric sites (1.81, 1.33 and 0.88 micromol m-2 s-1, respectively) and greater in mid-July than at the end of June (1.86 vs 0.77 micromol m-2 s-1). Foliar N was greater on thinned plots than control plots (2.6 vs 2.2 g m-2); starch was greater on mesic control plots than mesic thinned plots (16.3 vs 10.9 g m-2); and total soluble sugars (TSS) were higher in mid-July than at the end of June (16.5 vs 12.8 g m-2). Total monoterpenes, as well as five individual monoterpenes, showed a complex interaction between site drainage class, thinning treatment and time of sampling (P<0.05). For all sites and dates combined, total monoterpenes were negatively correlated with specific leaf area (r 2=0.46), and positively but weakly correlated with A max (r 2=0.35), foliar N (r 2=0.29) and TSS (r 2=0.24). Total monoterpenes were not correlated with the different measures of carbon to nitrogen ratio as predicted by the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis. Our results offer partial support to the different hypotheses proposing that foliage having greater resource availability, enzymatic machinery and potential for building storage structures will have greater monoterpene content. However, the strength of the relationships with monoterpenes often varied with sampling date, suggesting that phenological development may play a strong role in determining which factors control monoterpenes at a given time.

11498329|t|Importance of needle age and shoot structure on canopy net photosynthesis of balsam fir (Abies balsamea): a spatially inexplicit modeling analysis.
11498329|a|We have developed a spatially inexplicit model of canopy photosynthesis for balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) that accounts for key processes of light-shoot interaction including irradiance interception by the shoot, spatial aggregation of shoots into branches and crowns, the differential propagation of diffuse and direct light within the canopy, and an ideal representation of penumbra. Also accounted for in the model are the effects of the average radiative climate and shoot age on needle retention, light interception, and photosynthetic capacity. We used reduced versions of this model to quantify the effects of simplifying canopy representation on modeled canopy net photosynthesis. Simplifications explored were the omission of direct beam transformation into penumbral light and the use of different constant shoot properties throughout the canopy. The model was parameterized for a relatively dense balsam fir stand (leaf area index of 5.8) north of Quebec City, Canada, and run using hourly meteorological data obtained at the site. The overall performance of the complete model was satisfactory, with maximum values of canopy net photosynthesis of 23 micromol (m(2) ground)(-1) s(-1) (83 mmol m(-2) h(-1)), and a near-saturation of the canopy at a photosynthetically active radiation photon flux density of about 750 micromol m(-2) s(-1) (2.7 mol m(-2) h(-1)). The omission of penumbral effects through the use of unattenuated direct (beam) radiation at all layers of the canopy, as used for broad-leaved species, reduced canopy net photosynthesis by 3.7%. Analysis of the results show that the small impact of penumbra on canopy net photosynthesis stems from the high proportion of diffuse radiation (73%) estimated from our meteorological data set; single-hour results under clear sky conditions approach theoretical bias values of about 30%. Use of mean shoot photosynthetic, light capture and light transmission properties throughout the canopy biased canopy net photosynthesis by less than 3%. However, simulations carried out based on properties of 1-year-old shoots throughout the canopy overestimated canopy net photosynthesis by 9%. Use of the shoot as our smallest functional unit was a potential source of bias because the differential absorption of direct and diffuse radiation within the shoot could not be factored into the model. Other sources of potential bias are discussed.

11340042|t|Increasing the sink:source balance enhances photosynthetic rate of 1-year-old balsam fir foliage by increasing allocation of mineral nutrients.
11340042|a|To determine the impact of altering the sink:source balance on gas exchange rates in 1-year-old foliage of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), seedlings were either debudded before the growing season began or left intact. To assess alternative explanations for the observed photosynthetic response, additional seedlings were variously root pruned, shaded, drought stressed or deprived of fertilizer in combination with debudding. Foliar gas exchange rates and carbohydrate concentrations, xylem water potential and current-year growth were measured on three occasions spanning the shoot extension period. In addition, growth, foliar concentrations of chlorophyll, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic rate at different CO2 concentrations were determined 1 month after shoot extension ceased. Debudded seedlings had higher photosynthetic rates than budded seedlings, and the difference increased as the growing season progressed. We observed no evidence that debudding increased photosynthetic rate by improving water relations or by reducing foliar carbohydrate concentrations. Debudding increased foliar concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and chlorophyll, as well as quantum yield and photochemical quenching as determined by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Therefore, we conclude that debudding increased the photosynthetic rate by increasing the allocation of nutrients to 1-year-old foliage, thereby enhancing the amount or activity, or both, of photosynthetic enzymes, as well as increasing chlorophyll concentration.

11302853|t|Spectral reflectance of Picea rubens (Pinaceae) and Abies balsamea (Pinaceae) needles along an elevational gradient, Mt. Moosilauke, New Hampshire, USA.
11302853|a|Relationships among elevation, foliar morphology, spectral reflectance, and chlorophyll fluorescence of two co-occurring montane conifers, red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea [L.] Mill.), were investigated along two transects from 460 to 1460 m on Mt. Moosilauke in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, USA. Spectral reflectance (300-1100 nm wavelengths) and the chlorophyll fluorescence F(v)/F(m) ratio were measured on dark-adapted needles. Foliar morphology (needle size, shape, and mass) and nitrogen concentrations were measured in the laboratory. Reflectance spectra varied between species and with elevation. Two chlorophyll measures, red edge position and a chlorophyll-based difference index (Chl NDI = R750 - R705/R750 + R705), indicated more chlorophyll in fir than in spruce and decreasing chlorophyll with increasing elevation in both species. The structure-independent pigment index (SIPI = R800 - R445/R800 - R680) increased with elevation, indicating an increasing carotenoid : chlorophyll ratio. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI = R531 - R570/R531 + R570), a measure of photosynthetic radiation use efficiency, decreased with increasing elevation up to 1370 m. In the highest elevation site, within the stunted alpine krummholz at 1460 m, PRI was higher than at 1370 m, but still lower than at 1070 m. This same pattern was evident in the chlorophyll fluorescence F(v)/F(m) measurements. These independent indices indicate higher stress in spruce than fir, which may be related to the "spruce decline" reported in the northeastern USA. Results also indicate progressively increasing stress with increasing elevation up to 1370 m. Stress appears to be lower at 1460 m than at 1370 m, despite the harsher conditions at the very summit of Mt. Moosilauke. This may be a consequence of stress-tolerant physiology and/or prostrate architecture.

11276418|t|Photosynthesis and carbon allocation of six boreal tree species grown in understory and open conditions.
11276418|a|One-year-old seedlings of Abies balsamea (L.) Mill, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Pinus contorta Loudon, Betula papyrifera Marsh., Populus tremuloides Michx. and Populus balsamifera L. were transplanted in the spring, in pots, to the understory of a mixed P. tremuloides-P. balsamifera stand or to an adjacent open site. Growth and leaf characteristics were measured and photosynthetic light response curves determined in mid-August. Overall, the coniferous seedlings showed less photosynthetic plasticity in response to growth conditions than the deciduous species. Abies balsamea, P. glauca and B. papyrifera responded to the understory environment with higher leaf area ratios, and lower photosynthetic light saturation points and area-based leaf respiration relative to values for open-grown seedlings, while they matched or exceeded the height growth of open-grown seedlings. In contrast, seedlings of Pinus contorta, P. tremuloides and P. balsamifera displayed characteristics that were not conducive to survival in the understory. These characteristics included a high light saturation point and leaf dark respiration rate in P. contorta, and lower leaf area variables combined with higher carbon allocation to roots in P. tremuloides and P. balsamifera. By the second growing season, all seedlings of P. tremuloides and P. balsamifera growing in the understory had died.

11240627|t|Size-specific fecundity and the influence of lifetime size variation upon effective population size in Abies balsamea.
11240627|a|The hierarchy of plant size often present in dense populations of plants and the close correlation found between size and fecundity can result in an unequal distribution of fecundity, which reduces the ratio of effective population size/census number (Ne/N). Such an effect has been found previously in annuals, but no study has hitherto tested for the effect in the lifetime fecundity variation of a perennial population. We use the demographically stable size distribution to be found in natural, wave-regenerating populations of balsam fir, Abies balsamea, in order to estimate Ne/N. In both wave-regenerating and normal forests our estimated values of Ne/N were about twice those previously reported for annuals. We suggest that fecundity variance is expected to be smaller in trees and other long-lived perennials than in annuals because density-dependent mortality operates more strongly in the prereproductive phase of long-lived plants.

28308769|t|Testing the ecophysiological basis for the control of monoterpene concentrations along canopy profiles in thinned and unthinned balsam fir stands.
28308769|a|To determine which ecophysiological factors appear to control monoterpene concentrations in balsam fir foliage [Abies balsamea (L.) P. Mill.], the percentage of photosynthetically active radiation (%PAR), specific leaf area (SLA), light-saturated photosynthesis (A max), and concentrations per unit leaf area of foliar nitrogen (N), total soluble sugars (TSS), starch and monoterpenes were measured on current-year needles from three canopy levels (upper, middle and lower) the year following a pre-commercial thinning. The thinning only modestly changed the light profile within the canopy. %PAR was negatively correlated with SLA (r 2=0.62 in June, r 2=0.53 in July and August) and positively correlated with foliar nitrogen concentrations (r 2=0.51) within the crown profile. The positive relationship between N and A max was quite weak (r 2=0.15), suggesting significant variations in non-photosynthetic N within the canopies. Total monoterpenes were positively correlated with both %PAR (r 2=0.29) and A max (r 2=0.27), and negatively correlated with SLA (r 2=0.30). Contrary to that predicted by the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis, total monoterpenes were negatively and only very weakly correlated with the starch/N ratio (r 2=0.06) and were not significantly correlated with either the TSS/N or the [TSS+starch]/N ratios. Monoterpenes were positively correlated with both N and TSS, although the relationship varied with the phenological state of the foliage, i.e., monoterpenes were more highly correlated with TSS (r 2=0.67) (immature foliage) in June, and in July and August with N (r 2=0.63) (mature foliage). Thus, it appears that monoterpene concentrations may be controlled primarily by carbohydrate supply in the early growing season and later by enzymatic capacity. Data expressed on a dry weight basis showed a similar pattern.

10704644|t|Modern pollen-representation of some boreal species on islands in a large lake in Canada.
10704644|a|Studies of pollen source areas of closed-canopy sites are contradictory. Some authors found that closed-canopy sites mainly collect local pollen while others found more distant sources. This dichotomy might stem from the use of canopies of varying degrees of closure, and from variations in the pollen productivity of the local vegetation and the background pollen rain. Here, 30 islands were used to evaluate the pollen sources of closed-canopy sites. We compared pollen with the forest inventory in three quadrat sizes: 100, 400m(2) and on the whole island. Regression analyses showed that most pollen of Picea spp., Pinus spp., and Betula spp. comes from within the 400m(2) quadrat. Abies balsamea and Thuja occidentalis showed no relationship with vegetation in any of the quadrats considered, suggesting a more regional source. Insularity and island size are important factors influencing the pollen source area; correlations were stronger on islands located 120050ha. These results suggest that closed-canopy sites on islands may be useful in stand-level vegetation history reconstruction through pollen analysis, but that caution must be exercised in separating the local and regional signals.

10506547|t|The Demographic Cost of Reproduction and Its Consequences in Balsam Fir (Abies balsamea).
10506547|a|It is an axiom of life-history theory that reproduction involves age-specific costs in terms of survival or future reproduction. The measurement of costs of reproduction in plants is difficult, and few field studies have measured these costs in terms of fitness or demographic components, thus creating a hiatus between theory and data. In this article, we describe methods for overcoming the problem, illustrated by a field study of balsam fir. We used serial correlation and a permutation test to detect growth costs of reproduction and show how these translate into demographic costs when relative tree size (and therefore growth) is critical to survival. Using chronosequences, we reconstructed the age- and size-specific dynamics of a subalpine population of Abies balsamea. A matrix model describing these dynamics was then used to estimate age- and size-specific probabilities of future survival to maturity ([Formula: see text]). By using a regression model of the relationship between tree size, age, and [Formula: see text], we were able to estimate the maximum age-specific demographic cost of reproduction for trees of all ages. The shape of the age-specific cost curve for A. balsamea may explain why, contrary to a previously published hypothesis, age at first reproduction in A. balsamea does not vary between wave-regenerating and normal populations.

14759876|t|Crown architecture of Abies balsamea from four canopy positions.
14759876|a|Data collected from four distinct canopy positions from each of 39 Abies balsamea (L.) Miller trees were used to construct models to describe the cumulative leaf area distribution within the crown and to predict the needle mass of individual branches, the average branch angle, branch diameter, branch length, and crown radius per whorl, and the average number of living branches per whorl. We tested the hypotheses that regression models are equal among canopy positions and that a model to predict branch needle mass is valid at the northern and southern extremes of the central climatic zone of Maine. Canopy position had an effect on the models constructed to predict needle mass, branch angle, branch diameter, branch length, crown radius, and the number of living branches per whorl. However, compared with an expanded model that incorporated parameters calculated for each crown class, there was only a small loss in model precision when a general model constructed from data pooled from all crown classes was used to predict needle mass, branch angle, and branch diameter. Regression equations unique to each crown class were needed to predict crown shape and leaf area distribution in the crown satisfactorily. Our branch needle mass model, which was constructed from data collected at the southern extreme of the central climatic zone of Maine, consistently underestimated needle branch mass when applied to the northern extreme of the central climatic zone.

14871691|t|Estimating stem maintenance respiration rates of dissimilar balsam fir stands.
14871691|a|Stem maintenance respiration rates were measured in five contrasting balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) stands. At 15 degrees C, average respiration rates for individual stands ranged from 120 to 235 micro mol m(-3) s(-1) when expressed per unit of sapwood volume, from 0.80 to 1.80 micro mol m(-2) s(-1) when expressed per unit of stem surface area, and from 0.50 to 1.00 micro mol g(-1) s(-1) when expressed per unit of nitrogen in the living stem biomass, but differences among stands were not statistically significant. Coefficients of variation ranged from 50 to 100% within stands and were similar for all bases used to express respiration rates. Coefficients of determination for regressions between chamber flux and chamber values of sapwood volume, stem surface area and nitrogen content varied between stands and no one base was consistently higher than the other bases. We conclude that the bases for expressing stem respiration are equally useful. Respiration rates were more closely correlated to stem temperature observed approximately 2 h earlier than to current stem temperature. Among stands, annual stem maintenance respiration per hectare varied from 0.1 to 0.4 Mmol ha(-1) year(-1), primarily because of large differences in sapwood volumes per hectare. Annual stem maintenance respiration per unit of leaf area ranged from 3 to 6 mol m(-2) year(-1), increasing as sapwood volume per hectare increased.

14871721|t|Laterally applied Ethrel causes local increases in radial growth and indole-3-acetic acid concentration in Abies balsamea shoots.
14871721|a|The terminal (1-year-old) shoot of quiescent, two-year-old balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) seedlings was ringed with lanolin containing 0, 1 or 10 mg g(-1) Ethrel, an ethylene-generating compound, and cultured for 6 weeks under environmental conditions favorable for growth. Bud break and the elongation of the current-year terminal shoot were monitored, and the subjacent previous-year terminal shoot that had been treated with Ethrel was harvested to measure stem radial growth by microscopy, shoot ethylene evolution by gas chromatography, and cambial region indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentration by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Compared with the lanolin controls, Ethrel at 1 and 10 mg g(-1) did not affect bud break or longitudinal growth, but stimulated tracheid production and bark increment up to about 2-fold at the application site, though not above or below it. In addition, the 1 and 10 mg g(-1) Ethrel treatments increased the cambial region IAA concentration about 3-fold and the evolution of ethylene at least 40-fold at the application site, compared with unwounded portions of both treated and control shoots. The 10 mg g(-1) Ethrel treatment also stimulated ethylene evolution about 10-fold, both above and below the application site. However, this stimulation was not associated with an elevation in cambial region IAA concentration. Similarly, the lanolin control treatment increased ethylene evolution at the application site about 10-fold, without affecting the cambial region IAA concentration. Our results suggest that the localized stimulation of radial growth in woody shoots ringed with Ethrel is mediated by an increase in IAA concentration, which in turn is induced by a threshold, abnormally high concentration of Ethrel-derived ethylene.

28307131|t|Larval feeding behaviour affects the impact of staminate flower production on the suitability of balsam fir trees for spruce budworm.
28307131|a|Laboratory rearing of spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, in conjunction with field rearing indicated that the feeding behaviour of the larvae, which is affected by the insect population density, significantly influenced the impact of balsam fir, Abies balsamea, staminate flowering on spruce budworm biology. At low budworm density, the production of pollen in the midcrown of host trees reduced the insect development time by 5 days without affecting pupal weight, fecundity and survival. However, at high budworm density, the small amount of current-year foliage produced by flowering branches forced old larvae (sixth instar) either to feed on 1-year-old foliage (backfeeding) or to move from the midcrown to the lower crown section where staminate flowers are absent and more current-year foliage is available. When old larvae fed on old foliage, they exhibited reduced pupal weight and fecundity without losing the advange in development time that they obtained from feeding on pollen during their early stages of development. On the other hand, when old larvae moved to the lower crown section, they avoided the negative effects of backfeeding but lost the advantage in development time that was gained from feeding on pollen. Results from this study indicated that the production of staminate flowers by balsam fir trees could have opposite effects on spruce budworm population dynamics depending upon the insect population density when flowering occurs.

24197796|t|Effects of insecticide use on breeding birds in Christmas tree plantations in Quebec.
24197796|a|: This research, which was carried out in the spring of 1989 and 1990 in seven balsam fir (Abies balsamea) plantations in southeastern Quebec, examines potential deleterious effects of three insecticides (i.e. dimethoate, diazinon and insecticidal soap) on breeding American Robins (Turdus migratorius) (n=87 nests) and Song Sparrows (Melospizsa melodia) (n=41 nests). Through analyses of blood serum cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) activity both prior to and the second day following applications of the two organophosphorus insecticides, we showed that adult American Robins, Song Sparrows and Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina) breeding in the treated plantations were exposed to diazinon and dimethoate (p<0.05). Signs of exposure to diazinon (p<0.05) were also found in young American Robins. However, despite sharp reductions in blood ChE (and, in some cases, marked inhibition confirmed by 2-PAM reactivation), no cases of adult mortality were recorded following the treatments. Cases of complete or partial mortality were recorded in American Robin and Song Sparrow nests, even among control birds (non-exposed birds). No mortality was recorded for broods exposed to the insecticidal soap. Abandonment of nests and egg infertility were ruled out as possible causes of mortality. The cases of total mortality observed in American Robin and Song Sparrow broods exposed to dimethoate were similar to those recorded for control nests (18 and 25% compared to 14 and 21%, respectively). However, among American Robin and Song Sparrow nestlings exposed to diazinon, essentially twice as many cases of total mortality (31 and 38%, respectively) were recorded as for the control nests. It appears that American Robin eggs are sensitive to diazinon and dimethoate, particularly when spraying is carried out early in the incubation stage. In the case of the Song Sparrow, it is mainly the nestlings that succumb after diazinon is sprayed on them or when dimethoate applications are made during the egg stage.

14966011|t|Canopy dynamics and the morphological development of Abies balsamea: effects of foliage age on specific leaf area and secondary vascular development.
14966011|a|Data were collected from two branches from each whorl of nine open-grown Abies balsamea (L.) Miller trees to test the hypothesis that specific leaf area (SLA, m(2) projected fresh leaf area kg(-1) oven-dry foliage) is constant among five foliage age classes (current-year, 1-year-old, 2-year-old, 3-year-old and 4-year-old-plus). Between-tree variation in SLA was greater than within-tree variation. Differences in SLA among the foliage age classes were small, but statistically significant, showing a trend of decreasing SLA with increasing foliage age. Using data from two previous biomass studies, we found that three different methods of calculating SLA of individual trees produced the same projected leaf area estimates. To test the hypothesis that foliage mass increases with foliage age as a result of secondary xylem or phloem development, we examined the secondary vascular development of foliage collected from five age classes and three crown sections in an open-grown A. balsamea. The number of rows of xylem cells was not constant among foliage age classes, but the differences were small and showed no consistent pattern of change with foliage age. Total number of rows of phloem cells increased, number of living rows of phloem cells decreased, and the number of rows of nonliving crushed phloem cells increased with foliage age.

14966008|t|Interaction between indole-3-acetic acid and ethylene in the control of tracheid production in detached shoots of Abies balsamea.
14966008|a|We investigated the interaction between indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and ethylene in the regulation of the seasonal periodicity of tracheid production in 1-year-old balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) cuttings collected at different times during the dormant period. The cuttings were left with their buds intact or were debudded and treated either apically with IAA or 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid (Ethrel) in lanolin, laterally with IAA or Ethrel in lanolin, or basally with Ethrel, Co(2+) or Ag(+) in deionized water. The treated cuttings were then cultured for up to 5 weeks under controlled environment conditions favorable for cambial growth. No change in ethylene evolution was detected during the rest-quiescence transition, when IAA-induced tracheid production increased. The induction of cambial reactivation by IAA was associated with a rise in ethylene evolution, but there was no consistent relationship among IAA concentration, tracheid number and ethylene emission. Neither Ethrel, Co(2+) nor Ag(+) affected tracheid production when applied basally, except for 10 and 100 micro M Ethrel and 100 micro M Co(2+), which were inhibitory. In contrast, ethylene evolution was promoted by Ethrel and inhibited by Co(2+), whereas Ag(+) had no effect. Similarly, applying Ethrel apically or laterally increased ethylene evolution, but did not promote tracheid production except in the treatment in which 1 mg Ethrel g(-1) lanolin was applied laterally to cuttings treated apically with 0.1 mg IAA g(-1) lanolin, and in the treatment in which 10 mg Ethrel g(-1) lanolin was applied laterally to budded cuttings. We conclude that (1) ethylene evolution is not specifically associated with IAA-induced tracheid production, (2) ethylene does not mimic the promoting effect of IAA on tracheid production, and (3) ethylene can promote tracheid production, but only when its application results in a localized unphysiologically high concentration in the cambial region, which, in turn, induces an accumulation of IAA.

7859710|t|Electrophoretic analysis of coniferyl alcohol oxidase and related laccases.
7859710|a|Gradient gel electrophoretic methods enabled a distinction to be made between coniferyl alcohol oxidase (CAO) of lignifying cell walls and a pI approximately 9 pine "laccase" recently implicated in lignification (Science 1993 260, 672). Following treatment of a partially purified protein mixture from developing xylem of Pinus strobus with 2-[N-morpholine]ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that CAO had been selectively precipitated by MES and thereby purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Purified CAO was determined to be a cell-wall-bound glycoprotein (38% glycan), M(r) 107,500, pI 7.6, pH and temperature optima 6.3 and 30 degrees C, respectively. By graphite-furnace atomic-absorption analysis, CAO contained one copper atom per protein molecule. Proteins obtained from lignifying cambial derivatives of conifers (family Pinaceae) and from Rhus typhina bark were compared with CAO and the pI approximately 9 pine "laccase" following electrophoresis and Western blotting. For Abies balsamea, Larix laricina, Picea rubens, Pinus banksiana, Pinus taeda, and R. typhina, the isoelectric points of oxidatively active bands were identical to those of purified CAO. In addition, for all species only the pI 7.6 band was immunoreactive with antibodies against periodate-deglycosylated CAO.

28313739|t|Spruce budworm growth, development and food utilization on young and old balsam fir trees.
28313739|a|Laboratory rearing of spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana, in conjunction with field rearing, gravimetric analyses, a transfer experiment, and foliage chemical analyses at six dates during the period of budworm feeding activity indicated that the age of balsam fir, Abies balsamea, trees (70-year-old mature trees or 30-year-old juvenile trees) affected tree suitability for the spruce budworm via the chemical profile of the foliage. Insects reared on old trees had greater survival and pupal weight, shorter development times, and caused more defoliation than those reared on young trees. Young trees were more suitable for the development of young larvae (instars 2-5), while old trees were more suitable for the development of older, sixth-instar larvae. These results were confirmed by the laboratory transfer experiment. Young larvae fed foliage from young trees had higher relative growth rates (RGR), digestibility (AD), and efficiency of conversion of ingested foliage (ECI) than those fed foliage from old trees. These differences appeared to be related to the high N:tannins ratio, and the high contents of P present in young trees during the development of the young larvae. Old larvae fed foliage from old trees had higher relative growth rates, relative consumption rates (RCR), and digestibility of the foliage than those fed foliage from young trees. The high digestibility of the foliage of old trees was compensated for by a lower efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD), which in turn resulted in no significant effect of tree age on the efficiency of conversion of ingested foliage by old larvae. The low relative consumption rate of old larvae fed foliage from young trees appeared to be related to the low N:tannins ratio, and the high contents of bornyl acetate, terpinolene, and  -3-carene present in young trees during the budworm sixth instar. Variations in these compounds in relation to tree age may serve as mechanisms of balsam fir resistance to spruce budworm by reducing the feeding rate of sixth instar larvae.

7912501|t|Comparison of ribosomal DNA length and restriction site polymorphisms in Gremmeniella and Ascocalyx isolates.
7912501|a|The small subunit (SSU) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA genes from 27 specimens of the fungal genera Gremmeniella and Ascocalyx were amplified by PCR. Length polymorphisms were observed in the SSU and allowed the differentiation of four groups among the isolates tested: (i) Ascocalyx abietis; (ii) Gremmeniella isolates from Picea spp.; (iii) Gremmeniella isolates from Abies balsamea; and (iv) Gremmeniella isolates from Abies sacchalinensis, Larix spp., and Pinus spp. The amplified ITS was the same length for all Gremmeniella specimens and was 60 bp longer in A. abietis. Phylogenetic analysis of length polymorphisms and of 24 restriction sites in the SSU and ITS showed that Gremmeniella isolates were more related to each other than to the Ascocalyx isolate. Furthermore, seven groups were evident within the genus Gremmeniella. Our results confirm that Gremmeniella and Ascocalyx should be kept as different taxa and suggest that the taxonomy of the former could be revised to consider isolates from Abies balsamea and from Picea spp. to be two different varieties while incorporating Gremmeniella laricina into G. abietina, as a new variety.

14969913|t|A comparison of red spruce and balsam fir shoot structures.
14969913|a|I compared the shoot structures of high-elevation red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Needle widths, thicknesses and perimeters were measured to estimate total leaf areas from measured projected leaf areas. Measured needle perimeter/needle width ratios differed significantly from estimated ratios that assumed needles were either rhomboidal or elliptical in cross section. The vertical and horizontal silhouette shoot area to total leaf area ratios (STAR(v) and STAR(h)) of the two species were negatively correlated with needle packing and canopy height. Red spruce had higher values of STAR(v) than balsam fir at each canopy height, but STAR(v) declined with canopy height at a similar rate in the two species. The STAR(h) values of the two species did not differ significantly at a given canopy height. Needle packing increased with canopy height at the same rate in the two species. Needle weight increased in red spruce and decreased in balsam fir with increased needle packing, but showed no significant dependence on canopy height. Red spruce had higher values of STAR(h) than balsam fir at low values of needle packing, but STAR(h) values converged at high values of needle packing. The generally comparable values of STAR, along with similar needle diameters, may imply that red spruce and balsam fir have similar collection efficiencies of wet and dry particles. Measurements of STAR may be used to estimate leaf area indices (LAI) more accurately when using indirect techniques.

14969931|t|Neutralization and buffering capacity of leaves of sugar maple, largetooth aspen, paper birch and balsam fir.
14969931|a|We compared the acidity, the external acid neutralizing capacity and the buffering capacity of leaves of four commercially important tree species, largetooth aspen (Populus grandidentata Michx.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill), at two sites of contrasting soil fertility in southern Quebec. External acid neutralizing capacity (ENC) of leaves was determined by measuring the change in pH induced by soaking fresh leaves in an acidic solution (pH 4.0) for two hours. The ENC was highest for largetooth aspen (14.3 micro equiv H(+) g(-1)), and lowest for sugar maple and balsam fir (< 5 micro equiv H(+) g(-1)). The buffering capacity index (BCI) was determined by measuring the amount of acid necessary to produce a change of 5 micro equiv H(+) in the leaf homogenate. The BCI ranged from 883 micro equiv H(+) g(-1) for largetooth aspen to less than 105 micro equiv H(+) g(-1) for sugar maple and balsam fir. Leaves of sugar maple and balsam fir had a lower internal pH and a higher percentage of ENC over BCI than paper birch and largetooth aspen. Overall, ENC was correlated with the concentration of all leaf nutrients except Ca, and BCI was correlated with Mg, N and Ca. The site effect was relatively unimportant for all variables.

29231206|t|Identification and evidence for relationships among geographical isolates of Bursaphelenchus spp. (pinewood nematode) using homologous DNA probes.
29231206|a|Homologous DNA probes with a variable degree of repetitivity were used to identify the precise relationships between isolates belonging to the pinewood nematodes. Southern blot hybridization patterns obtained with genomic DNA from 13 geographical isolates confirm the existence of a B. xylophilus group and a B. mucronatus group within these pinewood nematodes. With these probes we were also able to discriminate between geographical isolates. The results clearly indicate the existence of three geographical subgroups in the B. xylophilus species: the United States, Canada and Japan with a close relationship between the USA and Japanese isolates. This supports the hypothesis that the B. xylophilus isolate, which was introduced into Japan, originated from the USA. Furthermore, these probes clarify the taxonomic status of a Minnesota isolate found on Abies balsamea and of the French and Norwegian isolates of pinewood nematodes. The nature of the isolated sequences is also discussed.

14972929|t|Changes in the water relations of balsam fir and white birch saplings after thinning.
14972929|a|In the autumn of 1987, young balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) and white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) trees were thinned and their water relations followed during the next two growing seasons. At the beginning of the first summer following treatment, thinned trees of both species had lower osmotic potentials at full saturation (Psi(pi,sat)) and at turgor loss point (Psi(pi,tlp)) compared with controls. At this time, Psi(pi,sat) was linearly related to the percentage of full sunlight reaching the trees. A higher sugar concentration in leaves was an important component of the lower Psi(pi,sat) of thinned trees. For the other two sampling dates during the first growing season after treatment and all three sampling dates during the second growing season after treatment, little osmotic adjustment of the thinned trees relative to the control tress was observed in either species. The absence of osmotic adjustment during the second growing season following thinning suggests that other mechanisms were responsible for the acclimation of the treated trees to the higher atmospheric evaporative demand. Sapwood permeability (k) of white birch was higher than that of balsam fir, but no differences in k or in sapwood area were found between treated and control trees of either species. Predawn water potentials (Psi(pred)) of treated trees were less negative than those of controls.

14972939|t|A method for reconstructing the development of the sapwood area of balsam fir.
14972939|a|Leaf area is commonly estimated as a function of sapwood area. However, because sapwood changes to heartwood over time, it has not previously been possible to reconstruct either the sapwood area or the leaf area of older trees into the past. In this study, we report a method for reconstructing the development of the sapwood area of dominant and codominant balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). The technique is based on establishing a species-specific relationship between the number of annual growth rings in the sapwood area and tree age. Because the number of annual growth rings in the sapwood of balsam fir at a given age was found to be independent of site quality and stand density, the number of rings in sapwood (NRS) can be predicted from the age of a tree thus: NRS = 14.818 (1 - e(-0.031 age)), unweighted R(2) = 0.80, and NRS = 2.490 (1 - e(-0.038 age)), unweighted R(2) = 0.64, for measurements at breast height and at the base of the live crown, respectively. These nonlinear asymptotic regression models based only on age, were not improved by adding other tree variables such as diameter at breast height, diameter at the base of the live crown, total tree height or percent live crown.

28312645|t|Factors influencing choice of balsam fir twigs from thinned and unthinned stands by moose.
28312645|a|Moose were observed to browse preferentially on balsam fir (Abies balsamea) trees in stands where the stem density had been mechanically reduced to about 2000 stems/ha from over 30,000 stems/ha. Twigs from trees in thinned and unthinned stands were analyzed to test the hypotheses that moose were choosing thinned stands to maximize intake of a nutrient, or avoiding plant secondary compounds deliterious to digestion. Analyses included: twig length, weight, diameter, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, dry matter digestibility, macroelements, crude fat (resins), crude protein, ash, and volatile secondary metabolites. Significantly higher concentrations of crude protein, P, Ca, Na, and crude fats occurred in trees from thinned compared to unthinned stands. Twigs from thinned stands were more digestible, longer, heavier, and had a greater diameter than those from unthinned stands. Several secondary metabolites were found in highest concentration in thinned stands. We suggest that moose chose thinned stands over unthinned stands for feeding because of high protein levels and large twigs. Trees in unthinned stands had protein levels below reported maintenance levels required by moose. Secondary metabolite concentrations were opposite to the direction predicted and the data do not support plant defence hypotheses for the chemicals analyzed.

28311186|t|Does climate affect host-plant quality? Annual variation in the quality of balsam fir as food for spruce budworm.
28311186|a|The hypothesis that annual climatic variation can affect the nutritive value of host-plant tissue for a herbivore was tested. Larvae of a single generation of western spruce budworm, Choristoneura occidentalis Free., were fed foliages that had been collected on five consecutive springs from a stand of balsam fir Abies balsamea (L.) Mill. Budworm of both sexes were about 20 percent heavier at pupation when fed folages that had been produced in early rather than later spring seasons. This could result in an estimated 25 percent difference in the reproductive rate of females. It is concluded that annual variations in spring climate can affect the nutritive value of forage.

14972810|t|Auxin and ethylene regulation of diameter growth in trees.
14972810|a|Recent studies on the phytohormonal regulation of seasonal cell-division activity in the cambium, primary-wall radial expansion of cambial derivatives, differentiation of xylem cells, and growth of the cortex in forest trees of the north temperate zone are reviewed. Indol-3-ylacetic acid (IAA, auxin) has been characterized by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the cambial region of Abies balsamea, Pinus densiflora, Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur. All of the evidence supports the hypothesis that developing leaves and extending shoots are primary sources of IAA. The rate of ethylene emanation varies among conifer species when adjoining phloem and cambial tissues are incubated in vitro. The cambium from young cuttings of Abies balsamea produces more ethylene than that from older cuttings. Ethylene production by seven-year-old Abies balsamea cambium is substantially increased in vitro when the tissue is provided with exogenous 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and IAA. In response to elevated ethylene concentrations, cortex growth is accelerated in both hardwood and conifer seedlings. Ethrel (2-chloroethylphosphonic acid) increases ray size and ray-cell number and promotes traumatic resin-canal development in xylem. In Ulmus americana, endogenous ethylene concentrations are inversely correlated with cambial activity. Ethylene decreases vessel diameter in Acer negundo, Acer platanoides and Ulmus americana. Several studies suggest that ethylene has a role in regulating reaction-wood formation in both conifers and hardwoods.

19290214|t|Genomic Differences among Pathotypes of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus.
19290214|a|Total genomic DNA from Bursaphelenchus xylophilus pathotypes MPSy-1 and VPSt-1 and from B. mucronatus was digested with restriction endonucleases. DNA fragments were electrophoretically separated, Southern blotted to nitrocellulose, and hybridized to genomic DNA from one of the isolates. The resulting hybridization patterns indicate genomic differences in repetitive DNA sequences among these populations. Greatest differences were seen between B. xylophilus and B. mucronatus, but genomic differences were also apparent between B. xylophilus pathotypes MPSy-1 and VPSt-1 and between a population from P. nigra in New Jersey and a population of a mucronate form from Abies balsamea in Quebec, Canada.

14975815|t|Differences in stem respiration responses to temperature between balsam fir trees in thinned and unthinned stands.
14975815|a|The change in stem respiration rates with change of temperature was significantly lower in a recently thinned balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) stand than in an unthinned stand. A comparison of respiration measurements made in the morning with those made in the afternoon indicated that there was more variation among afternoon readings and greater responses to changes in temperature among morning readings. Lower respiration rates in the afternoon were more common in the thinned stand than in the unthinned stand.

24310270|t|Orientation behavior of second-instar larvae of eastern spruce budwormChoristoneura fumiferana (Clem.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in a y-type olfactometer.
24310270|a|A two-choice, wind-tunnel olfactometer was designed and contructed to determine whether second-instar eastern spruce budworm larvae,Christoneura fumiferana (Clem.), could detect and discriminate among host-plant volatiles. Volatiles of current year's growth ofPicea glauca were preferred over those ofP. rubens, P. mariana, or air.Abies balsamea was preferred overP. mariana or air.P. rubens andP. mariana were both preferred over air. Two-year-old growth ofP. glauca, A. balsamea, P. rubens, andP. mariana were all preferred over air. Current year's growth of these host evergreen species was usually preferred over former year's growth of the same species in each case. 

856724|t|Organogenesis in in vitro cultures of embryonic shoots of Abies balsamea (balsam fir).
856724|a|Embryonic shoots of 15- to 20-year-old Abies balsamea (balsam fir) trees were soaked in (a) water for 15 min or 24 hr and (b) water with 1000 mg per 1 indolebutyric acid (IBA), N-dimethylaminosuccinamic acid (Alar-85), or 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone (PPZ), singly or in combination with 100 mg per 1 caffeic acid, for 15 min. After the soaking, the embryonic shoots were transferred to a nutrient medium. Nonsoaked (control) embryonic shoots elongated and often formed a basal callus but never showed organogenesis. The soaked embryonic shoots formed new apical buds, with or without bud scales, adventitious dwarf needles or shoots, and root- and embryo-like structures. One of the embryos germinated and formed an irregular shoot. No differences were found between the various soak treatments, except that the 15-min water soak was ineffective. The 24-hr water soak was as effective as the 15-min growth regulator treatments.

34493007|t|A Floristic Study of Forests and Bog Vegetation, Northwestern Minnesota.
34493007|a|Single vegetation plots in forests and bogs in the deciduous and coniferous-hardwood formation in northwestern Minnesota were studied according to the field methods of the Zurich-Montpellier system. Plots and species were arranged so that the greatest coincidence of occurrences was obtained. Species that show approximately similar amplitudes were united in sociological groups. Plant communities typified by these groups were placed in a hierarchy. The plant communities appear to intergrade but are not completely continuous. Definite concentrations of occurrences remain present in the ordination. Fourteen main types of vegetation are recognized. Their relations to the environment are discussed, and their relations to vegetation in other regions are indicated. Thirteen main types of vegetation (alliances) are recognized in the Itasca State Park region. Lowland vegetation has been divided into five alliances. In three of them the pathway of lake filling, starting in a eutrophic sedge mat and proceeding towards a mesotropic Picea mariana bog forest, is depicted. The two remaining lowland types represent eutrophic swamp forest of Fraxinus nigra and Ulmus americana on shallow peat or young alluvial soils. Upland forests havebeen divided into three "rich" deciduous types and five "poor" coniferous types.The rich types are represented by Tilia americana forests, Acer saccharum forests, Quercus rubra forests, and Populus tremuloides-Quercus sp. forests, allshowing representatives of the rich flora of the mesic Tilia-Acer forest. The coniferous forest types are represented by Popuus tremuloides-Quercus sp. forests and closely related Pinus resinosa-Pinus banksiana forests, Pinus banksiana forests on sandy outwash soils, and Abies balsamea forests in a young stage of development. Of these types the Pinus banksiana forest is floristically the best defined.

17814562|t|Identity of a Fungus Causing Blue Stain in Balsam Fir.
17814562|a|Blue-stained balsam fir wood [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] consistently yielded cultures of a nonsporulating fungus which were found to be the same as those obtained from ascospores of Amphisphaeria thujina (Peck) Sacc. collected from dead branches of this host. This blue stain appears to be identical with a previously reported but hitherto unidentified stain of conifers. The association of Amphisphaeria with stain in living trees does not appear to have been recognized before.
